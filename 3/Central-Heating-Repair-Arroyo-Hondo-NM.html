<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
