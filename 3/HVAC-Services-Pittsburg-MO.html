<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>A split cooling system may cost near that of a conventional HVAC system but has proven to be an alternative cost effective alternative to homes that do not have ductwork. Utilized in addition to other types of heating or cooling, such as portable or window a/c unit, area heating systems, or oil heating systems, it can enhance the comfort of your home while keeping your regular monthly energy costs sensible.<p>
<p>Both should be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
