<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
