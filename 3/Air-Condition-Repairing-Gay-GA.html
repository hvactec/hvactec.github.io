<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been running for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that unexpected shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Gay GA</h3>
