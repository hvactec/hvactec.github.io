<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Greenway VA?</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
