<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, because the unit is integrated.
