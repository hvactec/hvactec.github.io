<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air contaminant could likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and bacteria, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
