<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
