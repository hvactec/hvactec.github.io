Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
