<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
