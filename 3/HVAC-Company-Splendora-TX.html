<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
