<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on cost. It's tough to find a sincere AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
