<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>

<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Powder River WY</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Next, and possibly simply as essential when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
