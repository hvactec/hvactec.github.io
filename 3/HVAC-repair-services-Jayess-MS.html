Location the air conditioner back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Rising energy costs are not the only factor for high costs. Heaters often lose their effectiveness as they age, particularly if they have not been correctly kept. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace may run longer to offer the very same amount of heat. This will cause your energy bills to increase. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis might be utilized to help you pay for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace.
