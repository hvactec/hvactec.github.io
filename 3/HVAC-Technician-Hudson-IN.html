<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Hudson IN Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
