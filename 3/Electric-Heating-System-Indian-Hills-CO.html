We were in a time crunch for upcoming occasion, and Tyler came right out and had us linked in a couple of days. The systems works wonderful and the new office space feels very comfy.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, many Seattleites should discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a vicious, harsh summer season.<p>
