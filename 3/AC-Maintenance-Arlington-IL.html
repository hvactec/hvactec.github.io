<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
