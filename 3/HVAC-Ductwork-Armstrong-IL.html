<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ issue. Your company should check measurements of temperature, humidity and air flow. In addition, evaluation and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make certain it is working according to specs for developing use and occupancy) should be performed. A structure walk-through to check for odors and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings might be practical. Leakages need to be eliminated.

Air-side economizers likewise use outdoors air to condition areas, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outside air when appropriate.<p>
