<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top environmental risk to the health of children in the United States."

Airborne lead gets in the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was known how damaging lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gas, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
