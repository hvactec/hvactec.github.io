<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur must pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
