<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold growth and moisture inside your home is related to a higher occurrence of resident breathing problems.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is permitted to stream and rise out high structure openings to the outside (stack result ), causing cool outdoors air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can use extremely little energy, however care needs to be taken to ensure comfort. In damp or warm climates, maintaining thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation might not be possible. Cooling systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outside air when proper.<p>
