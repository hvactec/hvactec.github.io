<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
