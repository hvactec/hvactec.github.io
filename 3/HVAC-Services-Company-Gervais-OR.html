<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in Gervais OR</h3>
<p>Among the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is because something is dirty or stopped up Prior to trying to fix any issue, require time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is good to go, examine the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, call an experienced technician.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
