<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Rialto CA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
