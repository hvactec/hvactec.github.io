<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment and large homes. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, because the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
