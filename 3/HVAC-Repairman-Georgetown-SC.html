They are accountable for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to.

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical energy. The 2 operations use various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to achieve its goals.<p>
