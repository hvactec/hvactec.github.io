<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>A/c unit can produce a lot of water because they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Ac system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
