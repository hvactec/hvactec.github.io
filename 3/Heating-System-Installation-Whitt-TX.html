<h3>Ductwork Insulation in Whitt Texas</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>There are some more severe dangers for HVAC workers that could be potentially fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be toxic.
