Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>

Therefore, you don't have total control as to your AC unit product costs.<p>
