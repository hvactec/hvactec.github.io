<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine inspections.

<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildings can not be efficiently identified or remedied without a thorough structure examination. These examinations may start with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building private investigators evaluate the history of resident signs and building operation procedures. In some cases, these queries might rapidly discover the problem and on-site sees are unnecessary.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
