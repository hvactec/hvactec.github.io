<h3>Central Heating Installation in Costa Mesa California</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of dealing with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly 10 years and during that time, they have actually always supplied exemplary service.

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Costa Mesa CA Home</h3>
<p>Many people understand that outdoor air pollution can impact their health, but indoor air pollution can also have significant, damaging result. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants show that indoor levels of pollutants may be 2 to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution among the top 5 ecological health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
