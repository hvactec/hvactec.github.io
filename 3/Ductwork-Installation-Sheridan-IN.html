<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized building products, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, but much of the danger likewise originates from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can create pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
