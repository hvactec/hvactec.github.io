<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges used combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Folsom CA</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He assisted me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's hard to find a truthful AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>In 2011, NASA was on the lookout for a cooling system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They chose they needed expert help and spoke with numerous suppliers. Finally, after a rigorous selection procedure, the area company chose Dometic. We have actually had a great deal of firsts for many years, however this custom task provided special challenges for our engineers," said a representative for Dometic. After substantial trials in Arizona, where the system had to keep researchers and their devices cool and dry, our innovation is now ready for extra-terrestrial duty.<p>
<p>Its special feature is the existence of one main external system that connected to several indoor units. Such systems may be the best service for maintaining the microclimate in a number of workplaces, shops, big living spaces. Just few of outdoor systems do not intensify the visual look of the structure. The main external system can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
