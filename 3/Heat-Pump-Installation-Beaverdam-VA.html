<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
