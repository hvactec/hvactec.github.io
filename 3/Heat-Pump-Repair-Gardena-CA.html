<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
