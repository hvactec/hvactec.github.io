<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Cottontown TN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
