<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
