<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less regular (but frequently more severe) cases of people becoming ill after being in a particular building at a specific time. In these cases, there is generally a comparable set of scientific signs experienced by the individuals and a clear cause can often be found upon examination. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI triggered by germs which can infect a structure's a/c system.<p>
<p>Radiant heat offers a number of special benefits over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They don't have to stress over duct leakages, which are accountable for output losses of up to 30% in other heater types. Sending heat through solid things will also trigger it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A home heated up by a glowing system will heat up much faster, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the lots of advantages that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
<p>Many people do not realize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break gradually. That can jeopardize the performance of the system and eventually harm it enough that you need to purchase furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will carefully examine the connections and examine the efficiency of the system. They'll look for torn and harmed wires and change them in order to minimize the danger of fire and element failure.<p>
<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Specialists suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>
