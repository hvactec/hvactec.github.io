<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they need to be put.

<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
