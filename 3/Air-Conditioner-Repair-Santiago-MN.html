<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and building residents may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the type of particles and gases) from workplace makers, cleaning items, building and construction home furnishings, activities and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor contaminants. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
