<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home.

It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem.
