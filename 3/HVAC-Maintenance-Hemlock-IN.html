<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to measure, as one action stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repetitive usage of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
