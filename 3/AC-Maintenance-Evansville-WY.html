<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
