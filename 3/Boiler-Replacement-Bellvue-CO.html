<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home.

<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
