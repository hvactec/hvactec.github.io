One of the primary areas where blockages start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to routinely clean the condenser coil.
