<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

Similarly Camryn provided fantastic customer care at the end of the visit by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we may want to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the market.<p>
