<h3>What You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Felton PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
