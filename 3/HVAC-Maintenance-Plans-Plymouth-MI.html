<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should likewise be taken to minimize contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents ought to look out to the development of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures need to not be undertaken up until these problems have been corrected.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
