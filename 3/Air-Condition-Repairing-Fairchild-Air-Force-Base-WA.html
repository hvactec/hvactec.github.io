<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Fairchild Air Force Base WA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, roofing systems, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Both must be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
