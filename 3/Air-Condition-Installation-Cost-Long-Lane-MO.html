<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
