The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
