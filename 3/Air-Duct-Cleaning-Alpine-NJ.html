I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
