<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractors in Stanwood</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Just adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leaks. An experienced technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate quantity of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and efficiency of your air conditioning system is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
