<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
