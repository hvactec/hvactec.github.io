<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a warm water supply.

<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
