<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether a person responds to a toxin depends on individual sensitivity, which differs greatly from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned. Whether or not this is the reason for the problem, it's a good early treatment to attempt. Strategy to do this on a fairly warm day. Never ever use a power washer for this-- it can harm the fins. The following are standards; always describe your owner's handbook. Note: Always turn off the power before cleaning the unit.<p>

<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen. Also, if the air conditioner smells bad, there could be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat far from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter when every three months. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
