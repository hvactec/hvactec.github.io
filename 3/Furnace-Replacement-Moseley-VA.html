<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>I have used around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have actually signed an annual maintenance contract which covers 2 services every year. Ilan has actually been wonderful through all these years. Constantly keeps my system tuned and serviced. Have not had any issues. Whenever he sees any problems, he notifies me about it and proactively fixes the parts. Extremely pleased with their service. Would recommend them anytime.<p>
