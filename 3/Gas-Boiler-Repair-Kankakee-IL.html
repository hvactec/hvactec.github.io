<p>. Before selecting the installation location of air conditioning system, numerous primary aspects need to be considered. To start with, the instructions of air flow from the indoor systems should not fall on the location of rest or work area. Second of all, there ought to not be any obstacles en route of the air flow that might prevent it from covering the area of the properties as much as possible. The outdoor unit should likewise be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully discharged outside and the performance of the whole system will drop greatly. It is extremely suggested to install the air conditioning unit units in quickly accessible places, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak to your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
