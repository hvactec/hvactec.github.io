<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper.

When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy.
