<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
