As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
