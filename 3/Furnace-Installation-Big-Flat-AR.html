In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a variety of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weak point, confusion, disorientation, and queasiness, to tiredness in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with chronic cardiovascular disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are in some cases confused with the flu or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, babies, elderly people, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be particularly conscious carbon monoxide gas direct exposures.<p>

An air contaminant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and germs, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
