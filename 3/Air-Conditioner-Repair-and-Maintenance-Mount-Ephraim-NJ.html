<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
