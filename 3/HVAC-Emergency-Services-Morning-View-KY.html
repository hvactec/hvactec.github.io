<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.
