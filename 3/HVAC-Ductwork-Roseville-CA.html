<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not basic, because it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
