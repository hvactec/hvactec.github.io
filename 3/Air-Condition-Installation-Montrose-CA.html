<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are generally smaller sized than stick-built homes and utilize substantially less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Anticipate the average mobile house oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as lots of brands produce oil heating systems for this usage, and you may discover more alternatives with gas, gas, or electric heaters.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality.

Those procedures consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
