<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating units.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
