<p>Improve your services, earn more services revenue, and supply a fantastic customer experience. To make sure the unit you select is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load calculation quote to identify the precise type of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply replace it with the same size system you currently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is essential so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures build up inside your home, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

<p>There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any house. These include combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, coal, wood, and tobacco products; building materials and home furnishings as diverse as shabby, asbestos-containing insulation, wet or wet carpet, and cabinets or furniture made of certain pressed wood products; items for household cleaning and maintenance, personal care, or pastimes; central heating and cooling systems and humidification gadgets; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outdoor air pollution.<p>

<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Dundee OR - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by qualified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many individuals.<p>
