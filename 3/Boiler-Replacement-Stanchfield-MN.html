Due to the fact that the cost was undoubtedly reasonable, I did not trouble to get rival's quotes because of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate because it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
