<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the start of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
