<p>UW trainees, employees and visitors should have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform numerous activities. , if the air quality is bad it can affect a person's productivityConvenience health, and comfort.. The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and keep healthy and comfy environments devoid of contaminants. A crucial part of the program is reacting to and resolving concerns of structure residents about problems in their work environment.<p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other toxins that can not only filthy up the air, but result in other health complications.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
