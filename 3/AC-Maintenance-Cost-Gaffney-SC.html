<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>First, know that a bulk of your central air conditioning and system cost will originate from the system itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can in fact exceed $10,000 for bigger houses. As you saw just recently, you need an appropriately-sized unit for your home. Otherwise, the AC will break down faster than expected or your monthly energy costs will escalate. Therefore, you do not have overall control regarding your AC system material costs.<p>
