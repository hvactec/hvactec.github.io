By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in simply a few minutes, often without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
