<h3>Best Portable Air Conditioner in Lake Monroe Florida</h3>
<p>Luckily, you do not have to go through this procedure alone. G & S Heating Cooling & Electric employs only the most professional HVAC professionals, with years of experience in AC installation. No matter what your distinct circumstance is, we can find a cooling system that will meet your needs. Once you pick a suitable AC system, we can install the entire thing for you, start to finish. By trusting us with your AC installation, you can rest assured that it will be done securely and professionally.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed just a few years earlier.<p>
<p>Outdoor contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Professionals advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and generally are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
