<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
