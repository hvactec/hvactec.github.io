<p>We look at clues before we supply guidance to change rather than repair a heater. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
