<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the unit has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
