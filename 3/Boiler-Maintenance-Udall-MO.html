<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
