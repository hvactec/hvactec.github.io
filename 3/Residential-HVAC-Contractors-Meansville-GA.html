Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
