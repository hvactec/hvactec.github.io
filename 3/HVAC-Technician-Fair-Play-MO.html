<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
