<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical energy or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can attain approximately 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
