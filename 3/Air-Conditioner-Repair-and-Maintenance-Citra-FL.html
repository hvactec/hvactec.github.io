<h3>HVAC Technician in Citra FL</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to evaluate circumstance & decided to opt for them for the work. I am happy to say that not only did we get the central air going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke with from beginning to end were very professional, considerate and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen with time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
