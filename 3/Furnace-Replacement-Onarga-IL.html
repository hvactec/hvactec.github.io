<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in delay features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
