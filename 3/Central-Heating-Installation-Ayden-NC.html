<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Ayden NC</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
