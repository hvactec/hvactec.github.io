<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and workplaces matters, especially given that we invest most of our lives inside. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely humid environments or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity.
