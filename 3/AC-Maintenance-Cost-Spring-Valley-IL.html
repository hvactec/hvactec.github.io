<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
