The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
