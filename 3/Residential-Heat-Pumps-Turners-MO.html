<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
