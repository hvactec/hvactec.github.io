<h3>Air Condition Repair in Union KY</h3>
<p>Numerous commercial buildings utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can also utilize natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outdoor air presented into an area per a system of time, and is typically revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Also, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioning system: Don't place it in an egress window that functions as the only ways of escape should a fire appear.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Resource Query and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
