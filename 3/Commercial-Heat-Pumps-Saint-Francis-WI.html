Radiant systems depend on heat transfer by the infrared scientific concept utilized by the sun called line of sight."

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
