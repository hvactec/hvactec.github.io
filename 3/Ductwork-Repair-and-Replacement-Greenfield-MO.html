<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
