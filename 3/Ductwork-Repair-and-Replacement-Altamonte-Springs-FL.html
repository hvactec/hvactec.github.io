These convection heaters are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
