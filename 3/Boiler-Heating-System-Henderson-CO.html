<h3>Benefits of Expert AC Repair in Henderson CO</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or changing air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
