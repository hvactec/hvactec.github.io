<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
