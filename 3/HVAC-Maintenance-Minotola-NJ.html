Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
