Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling.

Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).
