Location the ac system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season.

<p>Some HVAC specialists sell service agreements to their customers, supplying routine maintenance of heating and cooling systems.
