A building walk-through to look for smells and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings may be handy. Leakages require to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become infected with germs or fungis and need to be removed, also.

<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
