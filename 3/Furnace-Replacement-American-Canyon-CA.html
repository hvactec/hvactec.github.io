<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in American Canyon California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part.
