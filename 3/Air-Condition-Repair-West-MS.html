<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
