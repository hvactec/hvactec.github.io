<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

This implies for every single system of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to 5 units are supplied as heat.<p>
