The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
