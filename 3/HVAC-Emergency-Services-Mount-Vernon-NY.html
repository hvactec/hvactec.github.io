<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
