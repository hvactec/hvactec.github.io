<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Stinson Beach CA</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to order it. My better half said that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have satisfied in a long time.
