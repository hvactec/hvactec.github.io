<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
