<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
