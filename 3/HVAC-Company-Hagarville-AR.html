<p>Chemical toxins: Unstable organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; furniture, flooring and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.
