<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
