Unvented or malfunctioning appliances or poorly used products can launch higher and often unsafe levels of toxins inside your home.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just radiant systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>
