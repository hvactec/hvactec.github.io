The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
