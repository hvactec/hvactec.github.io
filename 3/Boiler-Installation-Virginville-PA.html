My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
