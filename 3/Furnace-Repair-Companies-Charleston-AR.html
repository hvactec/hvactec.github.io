<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
