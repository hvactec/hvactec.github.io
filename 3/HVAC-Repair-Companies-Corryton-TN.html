What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
