<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Lightfoot Virginia</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working.

Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
