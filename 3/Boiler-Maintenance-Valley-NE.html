<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn provided terrific client service at the end of the appointment by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the industry.<p>
