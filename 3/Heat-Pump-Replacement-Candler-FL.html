My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>There's a big distinction in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of home heating-- convection.
