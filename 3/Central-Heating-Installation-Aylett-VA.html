<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
