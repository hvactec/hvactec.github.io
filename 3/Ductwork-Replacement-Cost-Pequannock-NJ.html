<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
