<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>AC Repair Cost in Lancaster CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
