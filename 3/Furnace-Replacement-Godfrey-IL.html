<h3>Best Heat Pump in Godfrey IL</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
