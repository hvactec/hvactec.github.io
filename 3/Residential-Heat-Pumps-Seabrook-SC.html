<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this.
