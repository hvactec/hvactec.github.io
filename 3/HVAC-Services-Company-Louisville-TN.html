<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building materials add to bad air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile organic compounds) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
