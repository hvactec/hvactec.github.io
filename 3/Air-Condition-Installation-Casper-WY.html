<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
