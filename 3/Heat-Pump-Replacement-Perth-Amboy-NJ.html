<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to check the a/c before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Repair in Perth Amboy NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
