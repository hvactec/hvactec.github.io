The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this.
