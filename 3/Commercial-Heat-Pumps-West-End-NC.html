Don't put the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier.

By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
