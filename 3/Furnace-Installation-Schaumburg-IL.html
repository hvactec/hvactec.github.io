<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
