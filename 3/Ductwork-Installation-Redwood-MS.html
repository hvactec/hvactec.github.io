<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.
