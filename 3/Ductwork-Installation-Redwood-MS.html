<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
