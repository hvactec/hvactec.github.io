<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
