<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a effective and straightforward method to reduce ambient air pollution and potential health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

In the process, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
