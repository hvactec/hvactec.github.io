<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences.
