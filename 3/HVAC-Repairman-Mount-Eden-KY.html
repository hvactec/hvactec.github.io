<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every three months. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and very well done. The installers were polite and knew exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and acknowledge easily people who are good at what they do.
