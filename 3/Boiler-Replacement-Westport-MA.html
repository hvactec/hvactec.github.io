They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
