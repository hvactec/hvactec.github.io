<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>

Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
