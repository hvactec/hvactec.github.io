<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and extremely little particles of dust.

For example, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable option to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
