Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
