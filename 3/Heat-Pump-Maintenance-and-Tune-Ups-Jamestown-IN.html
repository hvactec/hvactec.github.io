<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has actually ended up being an essential problem to house owners and health experts. Indoor air contamination studies have actually determined numerous contaminants that can be present in indoor air.

Appropriate ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are essential in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person should be called for nearly any maintenance aside from routine cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners must be professionally examined and changed prior to the start of every cooling season. Nevertheless, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup. While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak effectiveness.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>
