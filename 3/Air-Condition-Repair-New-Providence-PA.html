<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
