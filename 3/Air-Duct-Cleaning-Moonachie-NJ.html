<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years earlier and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation manual and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Most units feature a set that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will guarantee a safe and secure and airtight  fit in the window opening. And for additional support, specifically for larger a/c, think about buying a steel support bracket and install it to the outdoors house wall, straight below the windowsill.<p>
