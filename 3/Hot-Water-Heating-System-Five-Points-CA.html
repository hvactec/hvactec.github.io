<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
