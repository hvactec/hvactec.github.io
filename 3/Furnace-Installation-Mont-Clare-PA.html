<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
