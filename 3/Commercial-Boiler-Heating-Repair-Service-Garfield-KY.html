<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher earnings for air conditioning tradesmen.

According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical incomes for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>Think about possible effects of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater appropriately adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
