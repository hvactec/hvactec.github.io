<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in place.
