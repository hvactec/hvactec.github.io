<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
