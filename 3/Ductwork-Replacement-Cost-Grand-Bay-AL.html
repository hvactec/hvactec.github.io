<p>Specialist heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC specialists advise following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
