<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Although commercial geothermal systems have actually been in existence given that the mid-90s, and the concept established much earlier than that, its application in houses is still fairly brand-new. That indicates there are fewer expert installers than with conventional systems, and less competition means greater rates.
