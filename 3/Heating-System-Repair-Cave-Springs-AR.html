<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Cave Springs AR</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different home efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the required electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>If you see a decrease in heat output, first make sure the air filter is clean and in good condition. Next, examine other elements of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, debris and dust, a low-cost repair that can help improve performance. Likewise, check the vents and ducts for obstruction. Finally, make sure the thermostat is working and located correctly. Try moving it far from direct sunlight since this may affect temperature level readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature level in your home. Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your home feeling cold if this occurs. You may likewise need to examine your insulation to make certain that warm air does not get away from your space through different openings.<p>
