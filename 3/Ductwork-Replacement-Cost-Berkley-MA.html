<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Installation in Berkley MA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
