<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
