<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects toxins from indoor air (revealed as a portion efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system may be polluted (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for instance), and the system may spread these pollutants throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread out pollutants from one portion of the house to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can help reduce these problems.<p>

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor starts however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover.
