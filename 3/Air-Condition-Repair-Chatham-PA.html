<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The primary risk of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic homes of the spore cell wall. More major than many allergenic residential or commercial properties is the capability of mold to activate episodes in persons that already have asthma, a severe breathing disease.<p>
<p>Some health impacts might show up shortly after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a pollutant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is simply getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.
