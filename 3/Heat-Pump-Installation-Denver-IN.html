<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives generally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary rate of a system competitive with standard devices. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new construction (houses usually use between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
