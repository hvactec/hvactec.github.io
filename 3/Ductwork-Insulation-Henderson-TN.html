<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

Location control involves moving the pollutant source away from residents or perhaps transferring prone occupants.<p>
<p>If you have a big home, a house with high ceilings, a house with many windows or a house with insufficient insulation, heating your floorings instead of the air may not suffice to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed. Property owners would be well recommended to perform a house energy audit to examine where improvements may be made to increase the performance of an existing HVAC system. These modifications could really accumulate and potentially decrease your perceived requirement for in-floor heating.<p>
