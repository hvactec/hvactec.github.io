<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
