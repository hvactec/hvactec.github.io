<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F ¬∞.<p>
<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below.

Germs and infections, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality problem is produced simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference area.
