<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. Another element of the task is recommending clients as to how to avoid future issues and properly keep devices by, for example, frequently oiling parts or changing filters. In other words, the HVAC technician has three goals: Avoid problems. Conserve money. Stay comfortable.

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
