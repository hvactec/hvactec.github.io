<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Winter Park FL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor system.

For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
