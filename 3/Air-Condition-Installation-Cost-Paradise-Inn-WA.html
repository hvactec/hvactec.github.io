<p>I am changing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might choose to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, considering recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it might be better to replace the whole system.<p>
