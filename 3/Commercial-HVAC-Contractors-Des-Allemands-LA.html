<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Des Allemands</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
