<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system.
