<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
