<p>Air pollutants can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air pollutant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are normally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outdoors air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
