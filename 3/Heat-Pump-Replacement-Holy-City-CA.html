<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps men working. When a sales man concerns your home he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and must not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the choices for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>
