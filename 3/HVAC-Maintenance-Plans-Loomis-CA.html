<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
