<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality concerns. In the lack of such legislation, the "general duty clause" uses. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, specifies that a company must supply a healthy and safe workplace. Therefore, making certain the air is of great quality is the company's task.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
