<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most economical if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and harden-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat.
