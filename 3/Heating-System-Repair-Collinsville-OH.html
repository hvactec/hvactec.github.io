<p>Frequently, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be efficiently determined or corrected without a detailed structure investigation.

<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
