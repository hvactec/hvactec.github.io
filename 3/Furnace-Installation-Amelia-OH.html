<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
