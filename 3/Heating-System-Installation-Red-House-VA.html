<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Air conditioning system can create a great deal of water due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work.
