<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Heating systems that kick on often may be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>

This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
