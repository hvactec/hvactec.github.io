Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
