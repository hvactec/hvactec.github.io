<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
