<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Spring Park Minnesota</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the go to. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty.
