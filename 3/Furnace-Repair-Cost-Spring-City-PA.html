After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
