<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit. Loose, missing or defective wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves examining the suggested connections along with temperature level and pressure gauges. Take some time to check these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are protected and tight.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, a professional service individual should be called for nearly any maintenance besides regular cleaning.
