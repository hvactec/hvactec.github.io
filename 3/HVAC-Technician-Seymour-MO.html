<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes consist of bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
