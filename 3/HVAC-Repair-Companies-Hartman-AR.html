<p>There are lots of reasons that this can take place. The bright side is that you can deal with much of these factors on your own without the requirement to call for professional assistance. Start by opening the heat registers and after that move on to inspecting the thermostat settings. Next, check the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover.
