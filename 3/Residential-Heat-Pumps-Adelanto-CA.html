<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
