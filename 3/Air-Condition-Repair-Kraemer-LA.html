<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Kraemer LA?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>

You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
