<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
