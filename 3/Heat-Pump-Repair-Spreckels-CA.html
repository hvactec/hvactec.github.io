<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
