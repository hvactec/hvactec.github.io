<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very practical in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
