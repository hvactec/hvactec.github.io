<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>

Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens.
