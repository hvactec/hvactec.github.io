For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have actually utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
