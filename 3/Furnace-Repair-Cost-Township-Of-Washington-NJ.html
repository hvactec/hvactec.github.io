<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can likewise aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor.

Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
