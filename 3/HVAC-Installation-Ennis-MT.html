<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
