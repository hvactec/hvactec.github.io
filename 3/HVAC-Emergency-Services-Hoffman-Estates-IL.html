<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a large seller who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that consistently keeps track of energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to save money on expenses (particularly during the night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the shops change outside of an appropriate variety that might prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that perfect temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which typically consists of a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
