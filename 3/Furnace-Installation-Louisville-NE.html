<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered terrific customer care at the end of the visit by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested.
