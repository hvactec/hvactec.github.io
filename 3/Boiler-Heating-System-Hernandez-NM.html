<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>These principles-- and desire to suffer through the heat-- might currently be altering. Though just 33 percent of Seattle housing systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new real estate systems have been integrated in the four years since or are currently under construction. The large bulk of these systems are multi-family or mixed-use, where cooling is more of a market requirement, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>Even with the best unit and appropriate installation, there's always the opportunity that your furnace will malfunction. While some issues are brought on by normal wear and tear, most can be traced to inconsistent maintenance. Furnace problems can wreak havoc in your home, especially during the chillier months when you really need to heat your interior. It's handy to know how to troubleshoot typical issues so you can decide what to look after yourself and what to let a professional deal with.<p>
<p>Many HVAC professionals frequently discover themselves operating in confined and unpleasant spaces, at extreme heights, and often in hazardous conditions like extreme weather (to service outdoor heatpump and heat exchangers). They deal with numerous potential threats, consisting of electrical shocks, burns, muscle stress from raising heavy devices, and breathing problems brought on by the dangerous chemicals and refrigerants they deal with.<p>

<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter can worsen issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be aware of a few of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be hiding in your environments.<p>
<p>If you believe there is a health concern related to the indoor environment, please schedule an appointment for a medical examination at the University Worker Occupational Health Clinic by calling 919-966-9119. At this time, you will be asked to complete the Request for Indoor Air Quality Investigation type (found in the Indoor Air Quality Policy). Please submit and complete the form by means of email or fax It is essential when completing the demand that you offer as much information as possible for the EHS Responder.<p>
