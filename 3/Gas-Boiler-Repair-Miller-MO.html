In a contained system like a house, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones till a balance is achieved.<p>
<p>You should get your HVAC system visually checked at least as soon as every year to ensure all the systems are working well. This inspection is an essential aspect of HVAC maintenance.

Regular examination and maintenance also helps keep it in good shape and lengthens its life.<p>
