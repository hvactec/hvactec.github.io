<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate climate, where the temperature level doesn't get too low or too high. To put it simply, they are best for our Seattle environment! They are highly efficient, beating out most other types of heater in efficiency. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. Nevertheless, a geothermal installation normally costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which typically indicates it stops working in terms of return on investment.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
