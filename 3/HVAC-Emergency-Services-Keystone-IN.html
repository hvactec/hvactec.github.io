Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
