Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
