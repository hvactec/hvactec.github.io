These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
