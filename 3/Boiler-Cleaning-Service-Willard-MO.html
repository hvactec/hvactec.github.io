<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Willard MO</h3>

<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they diagnosed the issue and repaired really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. When the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and harden-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
