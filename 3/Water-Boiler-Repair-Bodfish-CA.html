<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very practical in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
