<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>

<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate items of incomplete combustion.

However more complicated concerns-- recognized by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 tactics below might be suitable.<p>
