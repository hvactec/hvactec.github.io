Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation).

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor.

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy comes to your home he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
