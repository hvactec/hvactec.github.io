Setting up a brand-new geothermal heat pump to deal with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>A customized a/c that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the exact same air path.
