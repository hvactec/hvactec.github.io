<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
