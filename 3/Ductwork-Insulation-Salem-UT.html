<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work.

Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
