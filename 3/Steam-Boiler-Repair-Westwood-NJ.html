<h3>Ductwork Insulation in Westwood New Jersey</h3>
<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of workers in the location, stale air may likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>When installing radiant heat, you must provide major idea to the kind of floor covering in the house. Due to the fact that it conducts and stores heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work reasonably well. Carpets will directly insulate the floor from the room, decreasing effectiveness, so if you want to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, use a thin carpet with dense padding.<p>
<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and ought to not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>
