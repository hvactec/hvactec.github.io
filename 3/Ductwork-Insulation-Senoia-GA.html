<h3>Choosing the Ideal HVAC System For The Project in Senoia GA</h3>

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
