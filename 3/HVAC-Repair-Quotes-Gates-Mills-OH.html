<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures develop up indoors.<p>
