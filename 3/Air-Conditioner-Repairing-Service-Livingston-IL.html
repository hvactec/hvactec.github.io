<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
