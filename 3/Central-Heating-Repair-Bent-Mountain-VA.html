<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
