<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
