<p>Since they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
