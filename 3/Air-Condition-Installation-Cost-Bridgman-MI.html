<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, triggering your new under tile flooring heating system too soon, before the mortar has actually treated, can trigger the grout to crack or to not adhere properly, and may void the guarantee of your mortar product. In some screening, even the tile broken when the system was run prior to the substance had actually treated. If you do not follow their guidelines, and mortar producers may decline guarantee coverage.<p>
