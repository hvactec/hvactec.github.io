<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Vail AZ</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of clinical evidence has suggested that the air within homes and other structures can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research study shows that individuals spend approximately 90 percent of their time inside your home. Thus, for many people, the risks to health may be greater due to exposure to air pollution inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
