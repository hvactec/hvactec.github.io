<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by many public water materials, it has actually been found in well water. If you've checked the air in your home and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, contact a laboratory certified to measure radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
