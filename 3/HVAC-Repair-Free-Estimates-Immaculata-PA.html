<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
