<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Smyrna GA</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
