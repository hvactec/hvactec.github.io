<h3>Methods To Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Parkton MD</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
