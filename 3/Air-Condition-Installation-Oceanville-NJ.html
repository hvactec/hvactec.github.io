<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead.

<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home.

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often vital to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this data may identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
