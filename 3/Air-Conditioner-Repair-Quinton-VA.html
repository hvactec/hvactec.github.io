<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Quinton Virginia</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the examination on a very cold day they killed the furnace declaring health risk factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a new homeowner I have actually discovered how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
