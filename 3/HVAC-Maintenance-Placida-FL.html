<p>Buildings are designed or meant to respond actively to a few of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and keep surfaces to improve their appearance, efficiency, or longevity. In other cases, such modifications subtly or perhaps dramatically alter structures in ways that might be essential to their own integrity or their influence on structure occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, some of the methods used by researchers studying communities, in order to gain a boosted understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
