<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Magnolia KY</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioner before you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
