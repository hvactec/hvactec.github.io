<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Hudsonville Michigan</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold enjoy moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other allergens under control. A dehumidifier (and air conditioner during summer months) helps reduce moisture in indoor air and efficiently controls allergens, Lang says. An a/c unit likewise decreases indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -victims.<p>
<p>Air conditioners can produce a great deal of water due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>
