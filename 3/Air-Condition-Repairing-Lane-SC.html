Climate Pro is trusted and genuinely cared about us and our situation. We came home one night to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to help us right before a holiday, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my friends.<p>

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Lane SC</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on different house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the needed electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
