<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Eagle WI</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them..

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
