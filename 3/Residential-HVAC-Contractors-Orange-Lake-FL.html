<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
