<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
