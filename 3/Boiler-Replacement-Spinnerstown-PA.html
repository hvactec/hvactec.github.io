<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
