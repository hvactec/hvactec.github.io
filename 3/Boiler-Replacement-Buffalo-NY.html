<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back.

I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
