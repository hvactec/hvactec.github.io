Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for house owners to consider.

For that reason, this may not be the best option for homeowners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
