Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can imply considerable savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively affects property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Magazine. Possibly Realtors need to think about a lot of variables to definitively mention what a radiant heat system may add to, or deduct from, any given asking price. That said, homebuyers aiming to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
