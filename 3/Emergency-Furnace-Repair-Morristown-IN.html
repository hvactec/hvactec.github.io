<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
