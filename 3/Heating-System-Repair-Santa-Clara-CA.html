<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
