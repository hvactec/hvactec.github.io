Setting up a brand-new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
