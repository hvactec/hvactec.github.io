The huge majority of these units are mixed-use or multi-family, where air conditioning is more of an industry requirement, states Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>
