Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very damp environments or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your home.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
