<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
