<p>Central air systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we advise using our insulation boards. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of enabling heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a house heating system, you may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
