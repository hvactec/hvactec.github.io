<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Norton MA?</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in house construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
