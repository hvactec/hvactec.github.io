<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in Sayre Alabama</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace must also be examined routinely. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire risk.
