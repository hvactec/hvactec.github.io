<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Laguna Niguel CA</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
