<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
