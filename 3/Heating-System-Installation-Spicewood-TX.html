<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A great place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI certification understand that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one component (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>The most typical kind of house heating system in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive option, but newer systems can be very energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems normally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely effective natural gas heaters can attain AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's development does not necessarily translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The air, ventilation and heating conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. Demand warms up during the summertime and winter season when customers require their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather shows up.<p>
