<p>Geothermal heatpump, as well as all other types of heatpump, have actually performances rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE. It's a clinical way of figuring out just how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. Most geothermal heat pump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
