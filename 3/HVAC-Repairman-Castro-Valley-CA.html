<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>While toxin levels from private sources might not position a substantial health threat by themselves, most houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a major threat from the cumulative effects of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that many people can take both to reduce the threat from existing sources and to prevent brand-new issues from taking place. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to act that can decrease the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>

For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially huge problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>Consider a whole home dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old adequate to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can enjoy a few of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing higher comfort at higher temperatures.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation.

Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
