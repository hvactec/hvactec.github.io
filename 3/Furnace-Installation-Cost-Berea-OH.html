<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the traditional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make certain that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. If the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
