<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by a lot of public water products, it has actually been discovered in well water. If you've tested the air in your house and found a radon problem, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>The majority of trustworthy HVAC service technicians will provide totally free estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who attempt to give you a free quote over the phone, as it may not accurately reflect what they will discover once they check out the system. Even if there is a charge for the cost price quote, that amount will generally be applied toward your balance due, should you decide to employ that contractor.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
