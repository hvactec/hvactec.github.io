The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
