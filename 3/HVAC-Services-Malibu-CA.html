<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
