<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

This need to work until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
