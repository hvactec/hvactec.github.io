<h3>Heating And Cooling Companies in Liberty Center IN</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
