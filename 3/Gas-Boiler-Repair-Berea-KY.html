<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover.

If  it does not, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
