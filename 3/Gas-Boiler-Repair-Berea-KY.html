<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found simply a couple of feet listed below ground. In the summer months, the procedure reverses, consequently cooling a house by removing heat. Underground temperature level stays continuous no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer dependable and constant cooling and heating.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ¬∞ F and an indoor temperature of 80 ¬∞ F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better service.
