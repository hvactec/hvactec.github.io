<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
