<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Elmira CA?</h3>
<p>In-floor heating unit can come with specific health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you just can't appear to warm up and find you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this concern since they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Additionally, because they do not trust fans, ducts, returns and registers to distribute hot air, in-floor heating systems can minimize the amount of dust and seasonal irritants in your home.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
