<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
