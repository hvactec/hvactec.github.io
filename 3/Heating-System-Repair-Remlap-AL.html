<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
