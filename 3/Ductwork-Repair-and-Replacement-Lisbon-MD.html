<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
