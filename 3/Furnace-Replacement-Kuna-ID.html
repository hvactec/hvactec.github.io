<h3>How to Get the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Kuna ID</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I went ahead and purchased this Carrier and I must state it does the job quite well. It takes extremely little time to heat up or cool down your house which is among the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had before. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
