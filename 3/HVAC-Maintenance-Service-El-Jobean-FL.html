<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
