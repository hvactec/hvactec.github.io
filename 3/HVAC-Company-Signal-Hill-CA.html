<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
