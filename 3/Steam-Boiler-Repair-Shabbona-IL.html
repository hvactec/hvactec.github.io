<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, because the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.
