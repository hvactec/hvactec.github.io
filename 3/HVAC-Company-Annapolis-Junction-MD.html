<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Annapolis Junction MD</h3>
<p>Particular instant results are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often challenging to identify if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is very important to pay attention to the time and location symptoms take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the location, for instance, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be worsened by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming indoors or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions widespread indoors.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
