<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
