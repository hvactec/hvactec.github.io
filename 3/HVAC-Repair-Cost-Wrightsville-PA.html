<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
