<p>A geothermal heater is more trustworthy than options, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and trustworthy  source of energy.<p>

The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
