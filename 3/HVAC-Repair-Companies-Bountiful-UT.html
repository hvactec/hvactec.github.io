<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Bountiful Utah</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>

<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
