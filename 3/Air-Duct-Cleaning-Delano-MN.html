Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure materials, smoking, family items, and using unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
