If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure.

<p>Variable speed is the method to go if it's time to upgrade an aging AC. Currently planning to change an existing a/c? Presuming your budget accommodates a variable speed unit, you need to definitely get one! You'll feel more comfy throughout the summer months, and your indoor air will be whole lot cleaner.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
