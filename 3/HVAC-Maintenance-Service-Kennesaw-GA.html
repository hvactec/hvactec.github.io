<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from products or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is typically important to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping track of information is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative need to ask for that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this data may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
