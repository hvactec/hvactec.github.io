Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works however the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
