The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
