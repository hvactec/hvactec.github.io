<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
