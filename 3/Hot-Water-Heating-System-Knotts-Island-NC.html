<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Knotts Island NC</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
