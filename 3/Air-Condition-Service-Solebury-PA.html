<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Solebury PA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was remarkable. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the necessary electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they should be put. Most frequently they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people primarily stay seated in that specific location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to position the sensor accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
