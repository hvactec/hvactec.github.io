<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While room a/c provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
