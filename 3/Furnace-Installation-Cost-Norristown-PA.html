<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
