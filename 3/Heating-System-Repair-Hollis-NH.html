<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<h3>Heating Service in Hollis NH</h3>

They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
