<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers.

When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components.
