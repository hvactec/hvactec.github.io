<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Services in Landrum</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as standard forced air or radiant floor heating or can be installed in a new structure. Required air systems will need a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heat systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends on the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is crucial iin ensuring the effectiveness and performance of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is determined in heaps. Typically, a 3-ton setup must suffice for the typical house, but house size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land availability are all elements which will affect the proper size for your specific home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can assist you properly size a system.<p>

<h3>How to Choose An Expert HVAC Technician in Landrum SC</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact. A lot of ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
