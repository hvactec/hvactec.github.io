It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Jurupa Valley CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
