<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
