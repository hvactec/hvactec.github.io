<h3>Heat Ventilation And Air Conditioning in Leitchfield Kentucky</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.
