<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items provide a threat only when they are dealt with in a way that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for significant illness.<p>
