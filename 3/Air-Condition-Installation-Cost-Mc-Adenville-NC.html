<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipes are seldom used due to long-lasting destructive concerns. Essentially all hydronic glowing flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, won't rust and can be found in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>
