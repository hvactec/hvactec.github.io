<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of permitting heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence residents.
