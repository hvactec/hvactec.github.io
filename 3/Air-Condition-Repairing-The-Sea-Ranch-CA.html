<h3>Air Conditioning And Heating Companies in The Sea Ranch CA</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
