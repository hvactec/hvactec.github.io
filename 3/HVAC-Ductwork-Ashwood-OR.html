<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
