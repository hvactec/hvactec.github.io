<h3>Truth That You Might Not Know About a Boiler Heating Method in Welcome NC</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
