<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Lee Center IL</h3>
<p>I was extremely pleased in the start since things ran efficiently without any noise. Additionally, I saw obvious changes in my electrical energy bills. After 2 years, things started to change. There have been uncomfortable noises. I got it repaired and inspected. I am hoping that is completion of the issue. In general, it has actually been a good experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the start. But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
