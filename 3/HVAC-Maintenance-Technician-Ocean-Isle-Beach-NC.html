<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies.

Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
