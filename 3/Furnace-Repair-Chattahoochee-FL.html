<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen.
