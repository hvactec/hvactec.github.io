<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in North Port Florida</h3>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by a lot of public water materials, it has actually been discovered in well water. If you have actually tested the air in your house and found a radon issue, and you have a well, call a laboratory licensed to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon problems in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they diagnosed the issue and fixed extremely rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
