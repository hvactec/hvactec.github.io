<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature. Furnaces that kick on often might be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been operating for a while, consisting of people. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
