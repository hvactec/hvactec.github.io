<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk to your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
