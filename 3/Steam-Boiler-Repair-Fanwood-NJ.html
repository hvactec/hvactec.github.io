<p>The function of the majority of building ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and constructing security at reasonable energy expenses. Load calculating is described as the Manual J calculation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video alone. Similar to measuring the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, determining the proper size of unit for your home likewise depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
