<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
