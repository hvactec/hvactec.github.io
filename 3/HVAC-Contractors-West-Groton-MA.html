<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair in West Groton MA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was needed and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they just didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
