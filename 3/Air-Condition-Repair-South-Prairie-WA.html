<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can build up and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these illness do not show up until several years after direct exposure began. Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothing and devices brought house from task sites.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
