<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to develop a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, r-410a and r-134a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating unit. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperature levels drop and reach below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>
<p>Many HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that enable homeowner to control the temperature and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to decrease the heat when you're not in house to save money on the energy bills and guarantee the system isn't overburdened. A professional technician will check the thermostat throughout the annual maintenance to ensure the actual temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. The technician needs to examine the thermostat's efficiency or examine the entire HVAC system if there's a difference in the temperature.<p>
