Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor.

ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Because it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you understand it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate impacts that are often mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, fatigue, disorientation and nausea. The impacts of CO exposure can vary significantly from individual to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
