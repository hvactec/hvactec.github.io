<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to buy it. My spouse said that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent individuals I have satisfied in a long period of time.
