<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A split air conditioning unit includes two main parts - a compressor located outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split air conditioning system count on a set of pipes to link the outdoor to the inside air unit which is why there are referred to as a ductless mini-split a/c unit installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to generate either cold or heated air.<p>
