<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Fisherville KY</h3>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
