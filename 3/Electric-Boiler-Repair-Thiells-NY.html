<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
