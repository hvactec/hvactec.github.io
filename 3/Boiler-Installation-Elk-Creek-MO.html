<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
