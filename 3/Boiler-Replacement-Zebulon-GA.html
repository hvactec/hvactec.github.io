During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.
