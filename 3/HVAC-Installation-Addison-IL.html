<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
