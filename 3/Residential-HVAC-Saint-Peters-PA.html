<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
