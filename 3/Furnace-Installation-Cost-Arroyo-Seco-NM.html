Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.
