<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at reasonable energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Manual J estimation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone. As with determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, identifying the correct size of system for your home also depends on the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
