A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>

All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
