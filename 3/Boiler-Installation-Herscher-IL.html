<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, kids, and babies are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
