<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Baker LA</h3>
<p>All of us face a range of dangers to our health as we tackle our daily lives. Driving in vehicles, flying in aircrafts, participating in recreational activities, and being exposed to toxic wastes all posture varying degrees of danger. Some dangers are just inescapable. Some we select to accept due to the fact that to do otherwise would limit our ability to lead our lives the way we desire. And some are dangers we might decide to prevent if we had the chance to make educated options. Indoor air contamination is one threat that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
