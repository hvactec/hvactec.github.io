Apotheosis Heating & House Comfort Solutions DOES NOT use the useless 'eyeball the flame' method that other companies utilize. Rather, the combustion is enhanced by determining the exhaust gasses and making clinical changes. This alone could pay for the whole maintenance go to at today's price of gas.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
