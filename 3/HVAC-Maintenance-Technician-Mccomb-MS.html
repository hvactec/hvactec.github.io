<p>A specialized a/c that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air path.

Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
