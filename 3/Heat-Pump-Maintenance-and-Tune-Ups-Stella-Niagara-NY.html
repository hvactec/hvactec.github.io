<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of pollutants (in the form of particles and gases) from workplace devices, cleaning products, construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outside pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
