(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
