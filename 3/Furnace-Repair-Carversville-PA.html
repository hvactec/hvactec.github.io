<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
