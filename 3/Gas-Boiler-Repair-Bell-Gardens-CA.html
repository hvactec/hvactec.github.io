<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
