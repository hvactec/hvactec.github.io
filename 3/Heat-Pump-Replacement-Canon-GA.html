Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
