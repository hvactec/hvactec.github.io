<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home.
