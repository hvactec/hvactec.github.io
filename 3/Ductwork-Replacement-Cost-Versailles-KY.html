<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your automobile.

In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every 3 months. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
