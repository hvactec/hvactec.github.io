<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Millwood KY</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have been finished, the last job is to test the system to make sure it cools successfully. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This final check may point out faults in the thermostat, which may be as basic as a requirement to change batteries. A failure to turn on might just include a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician discusses any issues or problems and makes suggestions about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
