<p>Since the 1980s, producers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more effective. This was initially driven by rising energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological concerns. Furthermore, improvements to the HVAC system effectiveness can also help increase resident health and productivity. 21 In the US, the EPA has enforced tighter constraints over the years. There are numerous methods for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and structure residents may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the type of particles and gases) from workplace machines, cleaning products, building and construction home furnishings, carpets and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
