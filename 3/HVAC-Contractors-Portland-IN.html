<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Portland IN</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to discover a truthful AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
