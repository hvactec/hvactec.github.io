<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
