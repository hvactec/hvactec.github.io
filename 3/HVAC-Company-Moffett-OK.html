<p>Consider a whole home dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old enough to validate replacement. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and allowing greater convenience at higher temperatures.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it might be better to change the whole system.<p>
