After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year.
