<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
