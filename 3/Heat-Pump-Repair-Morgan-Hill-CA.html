<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
