<h3>Furnace Replacement in New Waverly Indiana</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Throughout normal furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial developments can develop on internal elements. Airborne aspects from normal home items and surfaces can lead to formicary corrosion within your HVAC equipment. Left uncontrolled, these concerns can cause loss of effectiveness and worse, breakdown of element materials and a much shorter furnace life expectancy Over time, essential elements like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can start rusting, leading to decreased efficiency.<p>
