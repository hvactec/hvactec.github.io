Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video alone. Just like measuring the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, determining the proper size of system for your house also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
