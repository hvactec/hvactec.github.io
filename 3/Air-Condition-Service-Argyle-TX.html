<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other kinds of a/c, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to understand and keep.<p>
