<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
<h3>Air Condition Installation in Belleview Florida</h3>
<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Likewise, if the air conditioner smells bad, there might be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat far from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the a/c unit's evaporator coil.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps people working. When a sales man concerns your home he exists to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>

<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Belleview FL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
