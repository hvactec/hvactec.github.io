<p>We look at clues before we offer guidance to change rather than repair a heater. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be wasting money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, numerous Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system.
