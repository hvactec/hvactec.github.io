It safeguards the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or contaminants due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is extracted straight from the ground. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those used in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electricity, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating systems that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
