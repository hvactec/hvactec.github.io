After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
