<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you remain in luck, that's most likely your issue. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
