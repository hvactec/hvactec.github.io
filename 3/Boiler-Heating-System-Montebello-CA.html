<p>Indoor air contamination is caused by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can vary substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance task may need absolutely different steps and procedures than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being examined.

Sometimes, totally new ductwork might need to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
