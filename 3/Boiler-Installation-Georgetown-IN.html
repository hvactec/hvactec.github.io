<p>Many people ignore the degree of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is generally pictured as the black smoke released from factories. Little idea is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints used in the home. To intensify the problem, it is approximated that the typical American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside your home, and majority that time is invested in the house.<p>
<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
