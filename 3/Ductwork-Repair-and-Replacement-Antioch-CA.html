<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Antioch CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
