This last check may explain faults in the thermostat, which might be as simple as a requirement to replace batteries. A failure to turn on might simply include a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any problems or issues and makes suggestions about upgrades where suitable.<p>
