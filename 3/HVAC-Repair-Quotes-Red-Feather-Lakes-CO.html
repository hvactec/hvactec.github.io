Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Research Center.

<p>It is particularly essential to take as a lot of these actions as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can create high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or participating in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
