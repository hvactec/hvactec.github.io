<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
