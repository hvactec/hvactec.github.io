<p>Heating systems resemble automobiles. As they age, you can replace one part only need another part changed or fixed next year. It doesn't take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you needed to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below no night.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>We have been very pleased with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has actually worked extremely well and is so efficient that it considerably reduced our utility expenses - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergency situations they responded rapidly and fixed the issue.<p>
