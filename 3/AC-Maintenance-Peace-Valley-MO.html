<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more efficient service to your cooling issues than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. If your house is not heating up, only be concerned. However, if your system does not seem working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should contact a specialist to repair the unit and examine.<p>

The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
