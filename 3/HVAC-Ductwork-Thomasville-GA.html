<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly seem higher than typical, it is probably time to consider a new system.

If your heater is 25 years of ages or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>
