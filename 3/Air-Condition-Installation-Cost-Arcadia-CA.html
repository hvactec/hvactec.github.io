<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very small particles of dust.

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
