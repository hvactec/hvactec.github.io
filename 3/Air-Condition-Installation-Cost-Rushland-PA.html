<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to provide enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this.
