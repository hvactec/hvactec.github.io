<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
