<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on.

Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<h3>Facts All Riverview MI Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
