<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior.

<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate situation & decided to go with them for the work. I enjoy to say that not only did we get the central air going but likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were extremely expert, polite and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my requirements completely by offering an expert quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however numerous use the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution. If the current system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
