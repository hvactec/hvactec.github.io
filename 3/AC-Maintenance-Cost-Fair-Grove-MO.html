<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
