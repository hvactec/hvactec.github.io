<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Air pressure distinctions created by these forces move air-borne pollutants from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
