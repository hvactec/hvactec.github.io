This is due to the fact that you can switch off private rooms when you're not inhabiting them.

<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best choice for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
