<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
