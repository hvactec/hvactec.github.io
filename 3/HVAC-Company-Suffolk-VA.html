<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial price of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during new building and construction (houses normally use in between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
