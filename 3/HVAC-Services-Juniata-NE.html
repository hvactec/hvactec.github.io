<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
