<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy effective approaches of heating or cooling a home. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated in cooler months by moving and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a few feet listed below ground. In the summer months, the process reverses, thus cooling a house by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature level remains constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems offer reputable and constant heating & cooling.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a car radiator or common household a/c does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
