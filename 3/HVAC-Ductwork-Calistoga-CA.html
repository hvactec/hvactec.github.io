<h3>Electric Heating System in Calistoga California</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with two local companies for quotes. While both were useful and practical, Ballard Gas gave us a better offer, for exceptional service. Rather than an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heater and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these considerable however small changes in his quote. Due to the fact that of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological factors, we chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
