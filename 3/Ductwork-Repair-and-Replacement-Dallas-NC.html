<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Dallas NC</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in floorings, roofing systems, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and waters down indoor impurities tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products. Germs and viruses, animal dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may observe moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
