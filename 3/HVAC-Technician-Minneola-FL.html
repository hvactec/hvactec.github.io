<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
