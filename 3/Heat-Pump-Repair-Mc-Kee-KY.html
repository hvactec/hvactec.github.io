The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
