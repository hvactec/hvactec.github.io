<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature. Heating systems that kick on often might be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas heating systems While oil is typically utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the two types.
