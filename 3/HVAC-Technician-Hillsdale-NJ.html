<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
