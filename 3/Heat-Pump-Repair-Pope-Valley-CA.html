<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and treat-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
