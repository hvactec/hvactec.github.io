<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, considering that some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
