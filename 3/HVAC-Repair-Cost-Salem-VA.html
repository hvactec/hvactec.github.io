<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Understand in Salem VA</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature level, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
