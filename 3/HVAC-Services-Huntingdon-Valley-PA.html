<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Huntingdon Valley PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may discover undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your physician about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, there has actually been some publicity recommending that houseplants have been shown to decrease levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no proof, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants get rid of substantial amounts of pollutants in homes and workplaces. Indoor houseplants must not be over-watered due to the fact that excessively wet soil might promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals.<p>
