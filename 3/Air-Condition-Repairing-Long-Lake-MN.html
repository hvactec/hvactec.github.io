<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
