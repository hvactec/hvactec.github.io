<p>My oldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
