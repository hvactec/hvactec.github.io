<p>Customer items which contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to trigger cancer in animals.

<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher airflow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and new air purification technologies are becoming more common as available options in residential and commercial HVAC item bundles. Adoption of these innovations, however, has not been extensive, as consumers remain largely oblivious to the impacts of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heater, you may search for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>Often a momentary indoor air quality problem is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complicated concerns-- identified by regularly unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 strategies listed below may be appropriate.<p>
