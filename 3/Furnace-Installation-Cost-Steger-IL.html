<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to maintaining a correct temperature.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
