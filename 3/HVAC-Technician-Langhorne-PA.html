<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
