<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>

It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
