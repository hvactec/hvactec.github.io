<p>A specific air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the exact same air course. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
