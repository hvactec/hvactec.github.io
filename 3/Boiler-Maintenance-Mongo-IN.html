Ductless heatpump are terrific for additions since they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
