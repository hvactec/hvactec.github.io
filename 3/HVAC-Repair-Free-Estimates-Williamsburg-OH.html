<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
