<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
