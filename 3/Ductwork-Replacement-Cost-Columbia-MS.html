<p>We contacted Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to go with them for the work. I more than happy to state that not just did we get the central air going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked to from beginning to end were very professional, courteous and the work was really effectively done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Through normal usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system may become extremely filthy. These elements of the equipment are essential for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans up all parts, and inspects connections to ensure they are secure. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for proper function and general condition. This is an excellent chance to recognize parts that are worn or defective. When the issue is relatively minor, replacing them to repair the air conditioning might be a lot less pricey.<p>
