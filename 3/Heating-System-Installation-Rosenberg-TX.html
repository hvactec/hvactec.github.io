<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
