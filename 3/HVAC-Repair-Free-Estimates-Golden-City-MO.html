Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be aware of some of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be lurking in your environments.<p>
