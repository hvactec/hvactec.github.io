<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
