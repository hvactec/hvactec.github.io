Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, determining the right size of system for your house also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
