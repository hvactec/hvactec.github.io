<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON.

You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
