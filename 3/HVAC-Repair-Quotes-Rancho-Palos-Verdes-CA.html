<p>Consumer items which contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to cause cancer in animals.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

While an area heating system is in use, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
