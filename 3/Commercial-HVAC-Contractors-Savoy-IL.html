Combustion items from auto exhaust, heating systems, water heaters, area heaters, scented candle lights, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not properly vented can produce carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
