Localized glowing floor heat systems to be utilized in one or several rooms like restrooms, kitchen areas or laundry rooms are quickly refurbished with electric glowing floor heat.

Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and then change it ON.

You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
