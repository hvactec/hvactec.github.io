<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually ended up being a crucial concern to property owners and health professionals. Indoor air contamination studies have identified several contaminants that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion products, volatile organic compounds (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are important in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
