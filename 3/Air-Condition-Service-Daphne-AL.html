<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. Another aspect of the job is advising customers as to how to avoid future issues and appropriately keep devices by, for example, frequently oiling parts or altering filters.
