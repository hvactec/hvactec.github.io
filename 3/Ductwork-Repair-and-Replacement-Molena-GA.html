<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
