Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it increasingly challenging for your lungs to function appropriately, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they should be positioned.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are usually near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
