<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
