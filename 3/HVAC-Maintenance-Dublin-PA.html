<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain due to the fact that they just partially remove the radon decay products and do not lessen the amount of radon getting in the home. EPA plans to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a trusted means of lowering the health danger from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers more details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>
