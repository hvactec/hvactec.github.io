<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Stoughton WI</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their effectiveness over time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
