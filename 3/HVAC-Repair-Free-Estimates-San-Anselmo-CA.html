<h3>How to Choose a Specialist HVAC Tech in San Anselmo CA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
