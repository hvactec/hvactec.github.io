<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I have actually become reasonably skilled at researching products on line prior to acquiring them.
