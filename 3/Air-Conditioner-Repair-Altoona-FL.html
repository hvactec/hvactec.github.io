<p>While pollutants frequently found in indoor air are accountable for many harmful impacts, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are essential to produce specific health issue. Individuals also react extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air contaminants.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
