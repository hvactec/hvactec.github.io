Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
