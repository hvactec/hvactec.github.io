<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, much of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and perhaps refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimal performance and could get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy expenses to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not big enough for your house. If the system is too little, it will need to work harder and may overheat. Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
