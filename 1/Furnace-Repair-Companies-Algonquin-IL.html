<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
