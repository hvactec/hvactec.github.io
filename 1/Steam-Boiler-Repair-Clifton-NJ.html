<p>Just like many home improvement jobs, the cost of a full central heater can vary commonly based upon the size of the home. Many heaters will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
