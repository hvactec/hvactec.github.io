<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of factors including age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
