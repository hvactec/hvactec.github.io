<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, because it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
