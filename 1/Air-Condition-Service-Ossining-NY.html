<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same duration. Essentially, SEER offers more data based on how the EER performs in various temperatures. The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
