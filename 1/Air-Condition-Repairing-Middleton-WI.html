In the outdoor unit of this air conditioning system there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor units found in the room.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
