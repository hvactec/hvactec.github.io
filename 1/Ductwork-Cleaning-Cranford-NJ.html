<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
