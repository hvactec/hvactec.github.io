<h3>Heating System Installation in Tillman SC</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
