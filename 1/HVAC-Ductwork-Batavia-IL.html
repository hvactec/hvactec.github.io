<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies.

However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
