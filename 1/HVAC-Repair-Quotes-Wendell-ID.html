<p>Seattle heating systems can run nine months of the year. Based upon the typical temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a cars and truck it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life expectancy of 15 years.

<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
