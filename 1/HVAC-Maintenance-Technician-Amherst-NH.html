Some dangers are just unavoidable. Some we choose to accept since to do otherwise would restrict our capability to lead our lives the method we desire. If we had the chance to make informed choices, and some are threats we may choose to prevent. Indoor air contamination is one danger that you can do something about.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
