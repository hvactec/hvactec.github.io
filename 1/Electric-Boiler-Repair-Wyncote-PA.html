<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
