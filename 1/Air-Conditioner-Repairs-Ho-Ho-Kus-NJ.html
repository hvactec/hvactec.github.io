I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter season can worsen issues.

<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Often times, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best choice for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
