It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. a really helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
