<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.

<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Brownstown IN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
