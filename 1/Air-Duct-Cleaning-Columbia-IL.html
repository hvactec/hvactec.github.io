<p>A customized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
