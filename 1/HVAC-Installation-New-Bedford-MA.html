<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Production integrates quality products and outstanding service with development and technological advances to deliver high-performance heating & cooling products around the globe. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external system. In the outdoor unit of this a/c there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking a number of traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor units located in the room.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
