<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
