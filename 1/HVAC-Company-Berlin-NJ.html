<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes.

He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
