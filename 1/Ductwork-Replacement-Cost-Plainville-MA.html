<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being blocked with debris that can limit airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and checking filter can typically be done in just a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor.

In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
