<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature level of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater air flow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and brand-new air purification innovations are ending up being more common as available solutions in residential and commercial HVAC product packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been widespread, as customers remain mostly oblivious to the effects of air quality on health and productivity.<p>
