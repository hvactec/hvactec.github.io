(See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners must look out to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization measures should not be carried out until these problems have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues prior to we provide advice to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently.
