<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
