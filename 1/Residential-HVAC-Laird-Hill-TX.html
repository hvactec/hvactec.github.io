<h3>AC Compressor in Laird Hill TX</h3>
<p>Recently, Target told press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary intrusion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a 3rd party supplier. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in question was a refrigeration, heating and air  conditioning subcontractor that has operated at a number of places at Target and other leading sellers.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the skills or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still required to have a specialist technician check the system occasionally.<p>
