<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Chemical toxins: Volatile natural compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous.
