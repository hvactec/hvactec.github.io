Not only was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
