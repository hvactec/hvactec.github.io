They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
