When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

They can lead to an unsafe build-up and jeopardize your security if the exhaust outlets are obstructed.

They will try to find indications of deterioration, leaks, and back draft and repair the problem during their maintenance runs.<p>
