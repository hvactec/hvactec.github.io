<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
