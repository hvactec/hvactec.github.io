I appreciate the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, its an organisation design they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>

<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>

<p>Nick B. supplied extraordinary, tailored, attentive, and quality service. His communication design is friendly, effective and engaging. He clearly and thoroughly described all issues and repairs in a manner that made me positive in his capability to resolve my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to sustain another night without heat, during one of the coldest winters in recent memory. He also reacted to my call right away the next early morning, and coached me through a short-term repair to an issue that couldn't be fixed on the first go to due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
