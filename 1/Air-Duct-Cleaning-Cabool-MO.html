<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers into Residential Boilers at Cabool MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
