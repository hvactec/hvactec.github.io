<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Since it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you know it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers moderate impacts that are typically mistaken for the flu. These signs consist of headaches, dizziness, queasiness, fatigue and disorientation. The results of CO exposure can vary significantly from individual to individual depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
