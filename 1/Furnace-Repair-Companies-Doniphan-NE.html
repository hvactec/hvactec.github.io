<h3>Heating System Repair in Doniphan Nebraska</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
