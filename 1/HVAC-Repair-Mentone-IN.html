<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
