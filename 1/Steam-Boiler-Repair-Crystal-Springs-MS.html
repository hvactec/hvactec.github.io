<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy.

A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service strategy which usually includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
