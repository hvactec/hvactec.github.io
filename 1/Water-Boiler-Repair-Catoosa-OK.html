<h3>Furnace Installation Near me in Catoosa OK</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good opportunity; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on rare events.<p>
