<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, said Pueblo looks for more than just extra income or scale when it makes acquisitions - it tries to find companies that can broaden Pueblo's client base or supply a new line of services. For example, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo performed minimal pipes work for choose customers. With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its capabilities, making it possible for a boosted value proposition for a more comprehensive set of clients.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
