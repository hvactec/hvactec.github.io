That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
