<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices producer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one response specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented.
