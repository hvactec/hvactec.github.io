<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on.
