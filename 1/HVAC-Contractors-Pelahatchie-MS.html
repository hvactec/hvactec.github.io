The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
