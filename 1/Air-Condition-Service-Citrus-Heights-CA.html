<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Citrus Heights CA - Reasons Why You Would Need to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
