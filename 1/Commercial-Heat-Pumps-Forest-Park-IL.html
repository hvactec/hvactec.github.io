<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Forest Park IL Home Owners</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters.

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
