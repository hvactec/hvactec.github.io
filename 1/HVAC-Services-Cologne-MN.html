<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces at Cologne MN</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the air conditioning. I proceeded and bought this Carrier and I need to say it gets the job done quite well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool off the house which is one of the things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had before. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
