<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to supply enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
