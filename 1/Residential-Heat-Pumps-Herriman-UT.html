<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Herriman UT</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher airflow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air purification technologies are becoming more common as offered options in commercial and residential HVAC product packages. Adoption of these innovations, however, has actually not been extensive, as consumers remain mostly oblivious to the impacts of air quality on health and productivity.<p>
