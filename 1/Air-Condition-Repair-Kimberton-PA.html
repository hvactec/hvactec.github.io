<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
