<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
