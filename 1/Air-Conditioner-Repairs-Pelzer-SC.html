<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat.

Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly harden and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
