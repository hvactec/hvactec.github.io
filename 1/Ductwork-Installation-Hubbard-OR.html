The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power must not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the very same time, since the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, because it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts.
