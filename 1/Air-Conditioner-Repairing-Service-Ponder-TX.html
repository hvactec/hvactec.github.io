<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to develop a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-410a and r-404a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
