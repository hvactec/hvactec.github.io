<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces at Baroda MI</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in house building and construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, roofing systems, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
