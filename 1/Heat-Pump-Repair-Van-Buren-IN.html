<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might become stopped up, reducing air flow volume, quality, and distribution. They likewise might end up being places for molds and bacteria to grow and be dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be effectively preserved to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
