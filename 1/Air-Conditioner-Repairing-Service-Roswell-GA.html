<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Specialist heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your cars and truck.

Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
