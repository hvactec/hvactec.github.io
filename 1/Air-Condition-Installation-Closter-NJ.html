<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. Connection concerns along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the unit. Loose, defective or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves examining the suggested connections in addition to temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and safe and secure.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures develop up inside.<p>

<p>You could update to the highest efficiency equipment readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The typical house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>
