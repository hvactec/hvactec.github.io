A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
