<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Pocahontas Illinois</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
