Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
