<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are typically only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.

Therefore, this might not be the very best option for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
