<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical home air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
