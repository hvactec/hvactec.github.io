<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
