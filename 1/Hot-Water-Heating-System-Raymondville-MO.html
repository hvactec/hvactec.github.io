<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power should not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%.

Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
