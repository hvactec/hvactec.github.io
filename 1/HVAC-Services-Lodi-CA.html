<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Lodi CA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
