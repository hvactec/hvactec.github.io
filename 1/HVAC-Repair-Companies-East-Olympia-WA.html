<h3>HVAC Duct Repair in East Olympia Washington</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Radiant Heating System in East Olympia WA</h3>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
