<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this area.<p>
