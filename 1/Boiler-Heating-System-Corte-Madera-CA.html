<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
