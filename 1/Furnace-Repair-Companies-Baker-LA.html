<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the work environment indoor air investigations it has carried out. Examinations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the very same to be real. These investigations revealed that correct ventilation is important in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>

Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician examine the system regularly.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
