<p>My eldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
