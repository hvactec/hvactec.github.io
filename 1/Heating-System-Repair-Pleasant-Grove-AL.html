<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
