<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes dirty and old. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's efficiency. To make sure the system is working successfully, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
