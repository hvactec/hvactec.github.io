Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>Selecting the best size central air conditioning system for your home is very important, as is selecting either a plan system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one unit, or a split system, which positions the condenser outside the house and the fan and coil within.
