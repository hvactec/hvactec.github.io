<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Humansville MO</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
