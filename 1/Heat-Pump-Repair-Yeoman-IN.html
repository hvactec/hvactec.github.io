Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.
