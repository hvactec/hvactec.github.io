<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send exhaust outside.
