Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not easy, considering that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
