<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones received.

ProTex correctly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.
