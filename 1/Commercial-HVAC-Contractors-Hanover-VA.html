<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces in Hanover VA</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might set off attacks in people with asthma. There is proof that some people can develop a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has likewise been shown to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer in people.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
