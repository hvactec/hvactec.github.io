<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
