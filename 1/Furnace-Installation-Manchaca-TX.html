<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
