<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary price of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new building and construction (homes typically use between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
