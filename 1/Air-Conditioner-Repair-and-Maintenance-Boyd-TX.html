The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
