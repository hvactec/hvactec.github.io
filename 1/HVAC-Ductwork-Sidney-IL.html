<p>Many individuals underestimate the level of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is typically visualized as the black smoke produced from factories. Little thought is provided to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints utilized in the home. To compound the problem, it is approximated that the average American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time inside your home, and more than half that time is invested in the house.<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the centers managers who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us because of that. Most of the time they were initially interested in from another location monitoring some other aspect of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't up until later on, as they continued working with us, that they learnt more about and executed indoor air quality keeping track of to provide a healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to avoid the unfavorable effects associated with indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
