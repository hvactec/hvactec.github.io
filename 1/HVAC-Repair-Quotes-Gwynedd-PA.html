The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Once you've got the ideal furnace picked out and installed, you're going to need to keep it in good condition. Taking care of your furnace doesn't just include repairing it when it breaks.

You need to set up preventive maintenance for your furnace at least when a year.<p>
