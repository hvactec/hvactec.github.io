<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
