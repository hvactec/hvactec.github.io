<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The company began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, till the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under several owners. Goodrich's father was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to purchase what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when proper.<p>
