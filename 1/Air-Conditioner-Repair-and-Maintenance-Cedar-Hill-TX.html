<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
