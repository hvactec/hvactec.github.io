<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down completely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can typically be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
