<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
