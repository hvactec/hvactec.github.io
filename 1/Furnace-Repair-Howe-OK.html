<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever requires to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less effective. Central air systems and heat pumps typically last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement might be the most cost-effective service.<p>

<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
