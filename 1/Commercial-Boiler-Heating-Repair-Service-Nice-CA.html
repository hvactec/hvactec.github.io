<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Nice CA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
