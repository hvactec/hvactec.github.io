<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Lots of typical structure materials utilized prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Elimination of asbestos-containing materials is not always ideal because the fibers can be spread into the air throughout the elimination process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often advised instead.<p>

Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a substantial distinction, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>
