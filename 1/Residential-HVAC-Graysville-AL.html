<p>Biological impurities: the biological contaminants can include bacteria, infections, fungi (mold), dust mite allergen, animal dander, insect bio fragments, fibers and fiberglass, pollen, cockroach allergen, and so on. and may arise from inadequate maintenance and house cleaning, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or might be brought into the structure by occupants, seepage, or ventilation air.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
