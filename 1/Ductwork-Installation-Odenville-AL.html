<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Odenville Alabama</h3>
<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years old, repair is probably not worth the expenditure, unless it's an easy issue like debris blocking the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to examine not just the condition of your existing equipment, but also the ducts that provide the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your house.

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your cars and truck.

Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
