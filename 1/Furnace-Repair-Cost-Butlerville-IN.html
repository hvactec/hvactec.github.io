<p>Many people underestimate the degree of the indoor air contamination issue. Air pollution is generally visualized as the black smoke produced from factories. Little idea is offered to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints utilized in the home.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
