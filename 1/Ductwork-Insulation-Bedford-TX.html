Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
