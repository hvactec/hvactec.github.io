<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
