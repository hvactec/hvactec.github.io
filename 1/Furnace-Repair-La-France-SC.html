<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
