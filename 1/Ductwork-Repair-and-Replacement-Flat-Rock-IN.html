While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room.
