<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power should not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, considering that it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as merely radiant systems.

When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
