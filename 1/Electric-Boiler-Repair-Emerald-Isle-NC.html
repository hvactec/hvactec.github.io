Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
