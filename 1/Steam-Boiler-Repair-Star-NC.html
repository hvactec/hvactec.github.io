<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and homes matters, particularly considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the air conditioner is large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the ac system will need more energy to cool your home.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant.
