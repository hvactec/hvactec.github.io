<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outdoors air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
