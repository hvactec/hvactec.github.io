<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up simply a few years earlier.<p>
<p>Think about buying an energy-efficient model if your air conditioner is old. Search for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central units have to do with 15% more effective than standard designs. New residential central air conditioning conditioner standards entered into result on January 1, 2015; see the performance requirements for central air conditioning conditioners for information, and consider buying a system with a higher SEER than the minimum for higher savings.<p>

<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Thompsons TX - Reasons Why You Would Need to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the air conditioning. I went ahead and bought this Carrier and I should state it gets the job done rather well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool off the house which is among the things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
