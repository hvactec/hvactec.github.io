<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly might become stopped up, decreasing air flow volume, distribution, and quality.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
