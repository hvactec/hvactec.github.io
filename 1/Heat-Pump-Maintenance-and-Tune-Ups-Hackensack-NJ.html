<p>I have been using them for years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He assisted me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC man and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
