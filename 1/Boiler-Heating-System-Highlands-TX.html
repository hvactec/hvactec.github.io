<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the system has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
