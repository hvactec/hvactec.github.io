<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time utilizing Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is competent with these devices).

<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. Often there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in surprise or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
