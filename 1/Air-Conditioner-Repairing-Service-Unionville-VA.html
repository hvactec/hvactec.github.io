<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture inside is connected with a greater frequency of resident respiratory issues.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
