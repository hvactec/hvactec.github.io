<p>Today's home convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a house is the flooring mass.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements.
