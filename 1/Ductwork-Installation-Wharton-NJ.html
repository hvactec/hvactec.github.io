Convected heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them.
