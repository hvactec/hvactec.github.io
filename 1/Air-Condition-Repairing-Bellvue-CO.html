<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors.

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the correct replacement.
