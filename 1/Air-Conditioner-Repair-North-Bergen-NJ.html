The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power should not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, given that it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
