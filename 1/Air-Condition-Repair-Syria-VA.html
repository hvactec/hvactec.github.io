<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
