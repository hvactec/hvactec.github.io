This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts.
