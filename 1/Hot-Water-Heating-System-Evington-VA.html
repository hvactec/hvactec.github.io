<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
