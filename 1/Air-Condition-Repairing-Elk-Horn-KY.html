<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
