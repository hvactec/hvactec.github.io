<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items present a threat only when they are managed in a manner that develops dust including asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if appropriate controls are not in location. This can lead to the potential for considerable illness.<p>
