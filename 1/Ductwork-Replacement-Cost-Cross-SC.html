<p>Information supplied in this safety guide is based on existing clinical and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services must still be readily available for your home's systems.

<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
