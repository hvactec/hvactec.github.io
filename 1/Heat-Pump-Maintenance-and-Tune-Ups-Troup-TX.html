<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat.

Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
