<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
