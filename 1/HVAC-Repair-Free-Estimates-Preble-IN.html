<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>There are numerous reasons why this can take place. The bright side is that you can attend to much of these elements on your own without the requirement to require expert assistance. Start by opening the heat registers and after that proceed to checking the thermostat settings. Next, check the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover. You can likewise check the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and inspect the standing pilot light to make sure it is lit.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
