<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Given that the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns.
