<p>A customized air conditioning unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
