These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main problem.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
