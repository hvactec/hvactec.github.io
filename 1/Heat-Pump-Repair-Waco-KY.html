<h3>Air Condition Installation Cost in Waco KY</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
