<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
