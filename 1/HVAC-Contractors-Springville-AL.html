<p>If you have a large house, a home with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floors rather than the air might not suffice to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed. Homeowners would be well recommended to carry out a house energy audit to evaluate where improvements may be made to increase the efficiency of an existing HVAC system. These modifications could in fact build up and potentially decrease your perceived need for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>In addition, homeowners have a variety of alternatives to pick from in powering a floor heater. Glowing systems work with electrical, natural gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources.
