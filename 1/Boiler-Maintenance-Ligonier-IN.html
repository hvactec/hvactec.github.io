<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Since it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
