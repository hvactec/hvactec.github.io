<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units include not just the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally just readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
