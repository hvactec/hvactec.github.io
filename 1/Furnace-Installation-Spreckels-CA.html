<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
