<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
