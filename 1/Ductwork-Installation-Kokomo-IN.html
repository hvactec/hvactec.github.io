<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Furnace in Kokomo IN</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air unit. In reality, you can even DIY, in spite of our strong recommendation not to do so. If you do take our recommendation, anticipate to pay in between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to install central air conditioning. Moreover, cooling contractors may charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra supplies and devices.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
