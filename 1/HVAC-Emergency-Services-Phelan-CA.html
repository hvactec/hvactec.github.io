Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
