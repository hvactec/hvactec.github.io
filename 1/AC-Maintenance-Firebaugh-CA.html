<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
