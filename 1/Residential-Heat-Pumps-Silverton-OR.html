<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years ago and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
