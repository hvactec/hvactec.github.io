<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, including infected soil tracked inside, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
