<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air course.

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is really heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
