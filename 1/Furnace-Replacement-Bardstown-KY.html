A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis.
