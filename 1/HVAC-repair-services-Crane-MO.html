<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't position the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it because it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will reduce the system's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy.

A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
