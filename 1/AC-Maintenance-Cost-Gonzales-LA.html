There have actually been awkward noises. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is completion of the issue. Overall, it has actually been an excellent experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. However then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the professionals thought they just didn't seem right and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>

Airborne lead enters the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled.
