<p>All Points Heating offers house a/c, air conditioning unit installation, air conditioner maintenance that provide reliable, proven efficiency at high performance. Combustion products from car exhaust, furnaces, hot water heater, space heating systems, aromatic candles, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not properly vented can generate carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated.
