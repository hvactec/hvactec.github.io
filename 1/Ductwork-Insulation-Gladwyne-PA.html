<h3>Baseboard Heaters in Gladwyne Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>When setting up the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
