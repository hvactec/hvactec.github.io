A structure walk-through to look for smells and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings might be valuable. Leaks need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being infected with fungis or germs and need to be gotten rid of, likewise.
