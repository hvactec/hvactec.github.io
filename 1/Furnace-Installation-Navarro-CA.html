After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Purchase education and training: HVAC is not "general rule" work, and no two houses are the exact same. When service technicians are effectively trained, they choose and set up effective, safe equipment. They understand what it implies to offer superior workmanship, and they get less callbacks from dissatisfied clients. Founders and managers need to also stay abreast of developing technologies and industry best practices.<p>
