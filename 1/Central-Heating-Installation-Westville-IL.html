<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
