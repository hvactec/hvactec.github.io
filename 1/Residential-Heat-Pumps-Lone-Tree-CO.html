<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, kids, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the destructive impacts of lead. Kids might have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor environmental quality") describes how inside air can affect a person's health, comfort, and ability to work. It can consist of temperature level, humidity, absence of outdoors air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or exposure to other chemicals. Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does offer guidelines about the most common IAQ workplace complaints.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the amount (and often quality) of outdoor air that need to be continually supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON.
