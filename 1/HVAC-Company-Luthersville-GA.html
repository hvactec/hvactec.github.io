<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for homeowners to consider. Many times, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity.

For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
