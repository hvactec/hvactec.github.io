Temperature level levels need to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air circulation need to be avoided. Maintenance of appropriate temperature levels and humidity levels and appropriate air circulation will help to decrease the occurrence of upper respiratory signs, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
