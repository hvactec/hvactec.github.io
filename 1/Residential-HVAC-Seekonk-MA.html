<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
