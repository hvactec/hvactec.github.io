<p>The truth is, air contamination in your house can be simply as bad - or perhaps worse - than it is outdoors. And with the typical American costs 87% of their life inside your home, you 'd think that indoor air quality would be something we 'd hear about more frequently. However don't worry!

<p>Considering that cooling and heating work may also need repairing or setting up plumbing to provide oil or natural gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor may also be required to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a licensed plumber on call. However, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this profession. When getting a price quote, be sure to ask not just if a company is licensed, but also what kind of license it holds.<p>
