<p>Professional heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC experts advise following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
