<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any airflow constraint will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>We look at hints prior to we offer recommendations to change instead of repair a heating system. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently.
