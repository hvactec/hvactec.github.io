<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Utica MS Home Owners</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in house building and construction is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, roofing systems, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
