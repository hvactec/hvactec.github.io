<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
