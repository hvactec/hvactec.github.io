All the wet hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the area that is being cooled.

For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>
