<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>A Look At Ductwork In Berne IN Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
