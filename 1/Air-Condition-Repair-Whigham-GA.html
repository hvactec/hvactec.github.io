<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
