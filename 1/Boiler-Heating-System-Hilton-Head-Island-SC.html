<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally higher than numerous heat pump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the model you buy. One of the main advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating options. This implies it can warm up your house to the wanted temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
