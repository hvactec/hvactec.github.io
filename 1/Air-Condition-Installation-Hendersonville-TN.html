<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units.
