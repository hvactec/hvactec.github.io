<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a referral later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor.
