<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
