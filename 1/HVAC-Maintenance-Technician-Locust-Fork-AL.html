<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
