<p>At present, EPA does not recommend utilizing air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. Because they just partly eliminate the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the house, the effectiveness of these devices is unpredictable.

<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
