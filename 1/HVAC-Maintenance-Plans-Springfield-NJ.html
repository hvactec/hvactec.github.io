<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office complex such as high-rise buildings and medical facilities, vehicles such as cars and trucks, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do determine a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heater and select to install it in your house, you could be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be significant. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, house owners can anticipate to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.) Speak With the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax reductions readily available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heating system where you live.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for house owners to think about. Many times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
