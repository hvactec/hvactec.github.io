<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.
