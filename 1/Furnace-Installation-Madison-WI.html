<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily integrated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be set up in a brand-new structure. Required air systems will require a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heating systems will require water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is important iin ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is measured in loads. Usually, a 3-ton setup ought to be enough for the average home, but home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all aspects which will affect the proper size for your specific house. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you properly size a system.<p>
