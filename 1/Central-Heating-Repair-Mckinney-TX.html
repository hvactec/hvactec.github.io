<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Because it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
