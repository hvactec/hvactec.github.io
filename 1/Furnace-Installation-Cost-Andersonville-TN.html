All of the most recent heaters are far more energy-efficient than those installed even 20 years ago.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
<p>While toxins frequently discovered in indoor air are responsible for lots of harmful results, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are required to produce specific illness.

EDLab at Pure Air Control Services carried out a 10 year research study examining more than 7,000 structures and over 25,000 environmental samples that were gathered throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type included both commercial and residential. The majority of samples analyzed were checked favorable for germs and fungis.<p>
