<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
