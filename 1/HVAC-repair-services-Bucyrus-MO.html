<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Inappropriate adjustment, typically indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue.

Never use a gas range to heat your home. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
