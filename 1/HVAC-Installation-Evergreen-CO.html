<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
