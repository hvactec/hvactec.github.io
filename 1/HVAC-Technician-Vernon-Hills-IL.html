<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could flatter twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
