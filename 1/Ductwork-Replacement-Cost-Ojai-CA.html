<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
