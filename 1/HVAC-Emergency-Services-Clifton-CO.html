<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Think about prospective effects of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the maker's directions, especially directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system appropriately changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
