<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
