<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
