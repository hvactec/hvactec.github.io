<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and cure-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
