The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Buy education and training: HVAC is not "general rule" work, and no 2 homes are the exact same. When service technicians are appropriately trained, they choose and set up reliable, safe equipment. They know what it implies to provide top-notch craftsmanship, and they get fewer callbacks from dissatisfied clients. Managers and founders ought to likewise remain abreast of evolving technologies and industry finest practices.<p>
