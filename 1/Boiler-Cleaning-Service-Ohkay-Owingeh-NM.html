(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys.
