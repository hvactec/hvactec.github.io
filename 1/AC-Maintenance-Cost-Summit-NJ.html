Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
