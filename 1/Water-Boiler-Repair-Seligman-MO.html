<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not use agreements.  The so called reputable companies swindle more people than the fly by night outfits. Because I tried to work for them, I understand. Due to the fact that 90% of them are crooks, I give up. They walk in with or without an agreement and start selling you things you don't require.

<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Seligman MO?</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that things ran smoothly without any noise, I was very delighted in the start. Moreover, I saw visible modifications in my electrical energy expenses. After two years, things began to change. There have been awkward noises. I got it checked and fixed. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. In general, it has been a great experience. Reliable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
