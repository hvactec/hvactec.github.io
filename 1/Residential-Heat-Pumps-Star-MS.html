<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room.

As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
