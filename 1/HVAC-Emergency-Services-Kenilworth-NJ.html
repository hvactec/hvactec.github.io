<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ issue. Your employer should inspect measurements of air, temperature level and humidity circulation. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to ensure it is working according to specifications for developing usage and occupancy) need to be carried out.

<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
