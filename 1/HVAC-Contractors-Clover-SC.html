If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
