<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly seem greater than normal, it is probably time to consider a new system. New heating devices is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel expenses right now, not to discuss the money you'll minimize repair expenses. If your heating unit is 25 years of ages or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are fantastic for additions because they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter.
