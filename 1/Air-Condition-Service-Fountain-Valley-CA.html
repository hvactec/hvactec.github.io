<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Fountain Valley CA</h3>
<p>Spot Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans ought to be set up in all kitchen areas and bathrooms. These fans eliminate humidity and carbon monoxide. The most efficient fans are quiet and long lasting. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to ensure the fans run for a sufficient amount of time. An excellent rule of thumb is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
