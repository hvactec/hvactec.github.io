<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation likewise depends on the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system.

The 2 operations use different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
