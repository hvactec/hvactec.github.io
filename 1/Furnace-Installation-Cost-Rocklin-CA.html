<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is a really typical repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensor changed as preventative maintenance because the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

<h3>Ways To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System at Rocklin CA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater require fairly little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is vital to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank must be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed occasionally to eliminate tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas). The systems must be examined a minimum of twice each year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust collected in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Lots of factors affect IAQ. These aspects consist of bad ventilation (absence of outside air), problems controlling temperature, high or low humidity, current renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering into the structure. Often, particular pollutants like dust from building or restoration, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals launched as a gas over time) might trigger poor IAQ.<p>
