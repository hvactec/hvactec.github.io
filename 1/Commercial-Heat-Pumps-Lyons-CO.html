<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
