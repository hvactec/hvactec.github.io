<p>We called Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to assess situation & decided to go with them for the work.

Everybody we talked with from starting to end were really expert, polite and the work was really effectively done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the result of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too much or too little air blood circulation. Workplace temperatures should be preserved in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by excessive air blood circulation ought to be prevented.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Consider potential effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the producer's directions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater correctly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
