<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
