<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
