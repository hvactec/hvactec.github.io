All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house.

He is truthful, dependable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
