Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, since the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.

Nevertheless, new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the best conditions.<p>
