<p>Great service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really thorough in discussing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered fantastic customer support at the end of the consultation by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>For example, Provider has introduced its Unfavorable Air Machine for medical facilities that it says cleans up polluted air and avoids it from spreading to different sections of a hospital. Senseware, a smart structure start-up known for air quality monitoring, launched an option package in collaboration with other suppliers to help customers securely reopen their businesses. Molekule, a residential air cleanser start-up, released a new product, now for health care usage, and received a FDA 510( k) Class II Medical Device Clearance.<p>
