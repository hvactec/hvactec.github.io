<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon several aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a homeowner can take to choose items that will prevent indoor air issues from happening - a couple of them are discussed here. Initially, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, consider utilizing solid wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
