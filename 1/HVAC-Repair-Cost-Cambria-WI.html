<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
