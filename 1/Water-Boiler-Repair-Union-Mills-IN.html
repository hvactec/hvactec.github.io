<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
