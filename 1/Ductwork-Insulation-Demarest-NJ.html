So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the exact same).

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
