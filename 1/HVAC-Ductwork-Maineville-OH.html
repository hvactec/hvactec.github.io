<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have numerous control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the new control board should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
