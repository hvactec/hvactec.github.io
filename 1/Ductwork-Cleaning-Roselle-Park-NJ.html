Typically discovered workplace pollutants and their sources. include ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building products; formaldehyde from pressed wood items; other organics from building materials, carpet, and other office furnishings, cleaning products and activities, toilet air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copier, and photography and print shops; biological pollutants from filthy ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
