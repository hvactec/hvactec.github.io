<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
