<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
