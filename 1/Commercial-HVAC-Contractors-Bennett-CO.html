<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and building occupants might be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from workplace devices, cleaning products, building carpets, activities and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
