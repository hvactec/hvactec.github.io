<p>Air contaminants can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant resulting from gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where moisture levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
