<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>

You will also delight in a much more flexible system in terms of installation and cost.
