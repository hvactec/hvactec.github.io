<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
