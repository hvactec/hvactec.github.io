<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
