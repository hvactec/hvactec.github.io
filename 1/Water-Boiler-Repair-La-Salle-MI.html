<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time.

Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
