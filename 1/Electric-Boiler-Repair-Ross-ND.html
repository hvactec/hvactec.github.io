<p>UW trainees, visitors and staff members ought to have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform numerous activities. , if the air quality is poor it can affect a person's health, comfort, and productivityPerformancePerformance The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and maintain healthy and comfortable environments without pollutants.

<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.
