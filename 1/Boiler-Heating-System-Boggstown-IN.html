<p>Iâ $ m truly fussy with my stuff. I like my devices and appliances initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So buying this air conditioning unit to replace my old one was rather of a challenging fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Since it has restored my faith in good manufacturing, am glad I got this however. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this brand-new Carrier I got considering that I purchased it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s just best.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
