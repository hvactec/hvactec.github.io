<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still heats to the right temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel extremely hot. Just be worried if your house is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you need to hire a professional to repair the system and inspect.<p>
