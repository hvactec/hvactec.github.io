<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next action is to defrost your air conditioning devices. The simplest way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
