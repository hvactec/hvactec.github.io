<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, an expert service person should be required nearly any maintenance besides regular cleaning. Central air conditioners must be professionally inspected and changed before the beginning of every cooling season. Nevertheless, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>
