<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
