<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Murchison TX</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Initially make sure the air filter is tidy and in good condition if you see a decrease in heat output. Next, inspect other parts of the furnace for any build-up of debris, dirt and dust, an affordable fix that can help enhance performance. Likewise, check the vents and ducts for obstruction. Finally, make sure the thermostat is working and located appropriately. Attempt moving it far from direct sunshine considering that this may affect temperature level readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature level in your house. If this occurs, your thermostat will turn off the furnace too early and leave your house sensation cold. You may also need to inspect your insulation to make sure that warm air does not leave from your space through various openings.<p>
