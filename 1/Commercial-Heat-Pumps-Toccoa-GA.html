<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Also known as mini divides" or split level Air conditioners," ductless A/cs can be set up in your house without all the pesky ductwork that features traditional HVAC systems.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Lots of people are becoming more concerned and mindful about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt including toxins and allergens can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Occasionally it needs to be eliminated to revitalize the quality and boost of indoor air and improve the cooling.
