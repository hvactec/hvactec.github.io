<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Atlanta IN</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floors, and roofings. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants exhaust them from the house.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative study discovered. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
