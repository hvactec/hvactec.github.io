<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts however the fan does not. Shut down the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover.

<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years ago and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
