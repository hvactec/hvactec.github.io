<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning solid fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can vary significantly from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job may require completely different steps and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being checked. Installations can also vary considerably, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. In many cases, completely brand-new ductwork may require to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to develop a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-134a and r-404a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently commonly used in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
