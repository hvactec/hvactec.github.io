<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
