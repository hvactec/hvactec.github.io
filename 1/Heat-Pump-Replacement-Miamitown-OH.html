<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
