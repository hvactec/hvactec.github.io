<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.

<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
