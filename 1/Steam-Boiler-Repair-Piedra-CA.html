<h3>HVAC Duct Repair in Piedra California</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry. Also, if the air conditioning system smells bad, there might be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil absorbs the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating unit. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperatures drop and reach listed below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which instantly shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
