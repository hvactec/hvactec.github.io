<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists utilized various methodologies. The CMHC study contacted a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they were part of a research study, and the researchers did not control for time spent or methods utilized. The EPA research study prescribed and managed approaches utilized on a smaller number of homes.

<p>A customized ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
