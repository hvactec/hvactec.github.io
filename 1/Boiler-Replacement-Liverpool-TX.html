<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

<p>Similar to many home improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heater can vary widely based upon the size of the home. The majority of furnaces will last between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner must consider heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the home.

It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
