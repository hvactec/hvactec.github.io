<p>UW trainees, visitors and staff members must have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out different activities. If the air quality is poor it can affect a person's efficiency, comfort, and health.  The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and maintain comfortable and healthy environments free of contaminants. A crucial part of the program is responding to and resolving issues of structure residents about problems in their workplace.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one aspect (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
