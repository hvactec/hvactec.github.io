<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
