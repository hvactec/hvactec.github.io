If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals used in the building or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor pollutants.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
