<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
