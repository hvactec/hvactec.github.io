<p>Some biological impurities trigger allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health issue brought on by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
