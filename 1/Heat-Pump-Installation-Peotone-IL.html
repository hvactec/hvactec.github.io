<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated delay features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

He set up 3 Nest Learning Thermostats in my home. His understanding of the item was outstanding. His craftsmanship was excellent and he didn't leave a mess.

Nevertheless, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
