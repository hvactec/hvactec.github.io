<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
