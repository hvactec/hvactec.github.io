<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a range of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has recognized building products, home furnishings, and mold as severe concerns, however much of the threat likewise comes from burning things. For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
