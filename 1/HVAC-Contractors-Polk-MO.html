<p>For instance, issues develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in adequate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Incorrectly situated outside air consumption vents can likewise generate air contaminated with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological impurities that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
