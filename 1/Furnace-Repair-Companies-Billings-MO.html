<h3>Furnace Installation in Billings MO</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable environment, or simply a high level of competitors for skilled trades.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
