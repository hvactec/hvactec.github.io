<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house.

The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
