<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
