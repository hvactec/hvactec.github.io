<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner at Kelton PA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit.
