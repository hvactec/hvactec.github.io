<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Hickory Grove SC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<h3>HVAC Technician in Hickory Grove SC</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a range of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has recognized building materials, home furnishings, and mold as major concerns, however much of the danger also originates from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially huge concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>The most common type of home heating system in the U.S. burns gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly alternative, however newer systems can be very energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems generally attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly efficient natural gas heaters can accomplish AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
