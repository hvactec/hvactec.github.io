<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators.

Convected heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
