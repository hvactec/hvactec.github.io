<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and houses matters, especially since we invest most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
