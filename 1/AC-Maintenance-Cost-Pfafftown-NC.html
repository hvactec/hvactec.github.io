Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal components too. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous rooms simultaneously, but are not extremely energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the home.
