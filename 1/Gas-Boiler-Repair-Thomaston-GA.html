<p>. Prior to selecting the installation location of air conditioning unit, a number of main elements require to be considered. First off, the instructions of air flow from the indoor systems need to not fall on the location of rest or work area.

The outside system should also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively released outside and the productivity of the whole system will drop sharply. It is extremely a good idea to install the air conditioner systems in easily accessible locations, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
