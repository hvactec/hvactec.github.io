Ilan always makes himself available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is skilled with these devices).

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
