<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
