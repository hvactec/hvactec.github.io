<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>A customized air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the very same air path. A basic a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the space since its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
