<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

A building walk-through to check for smells and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings might be helpful. Leaks require to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with fungi or bacteria and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some situations, particular testing for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
