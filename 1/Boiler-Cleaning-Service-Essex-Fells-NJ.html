A building walk-through to check for smells and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings might be helpful. Leaks require to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with fungi or bacteria and need to be gotten rid of, also.
