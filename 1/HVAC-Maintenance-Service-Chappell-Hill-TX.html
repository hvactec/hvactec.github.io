<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the go to. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
