After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
