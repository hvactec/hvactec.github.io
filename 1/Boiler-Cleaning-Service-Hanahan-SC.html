<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, trustworthy, and reasonable on price. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time utilizing All the time. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is knowledgeable with these gadgets).

<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
