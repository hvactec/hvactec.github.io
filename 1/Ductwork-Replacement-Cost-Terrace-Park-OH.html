<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on.
