<p>A specific air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a basic air conditioner in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air course. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is removed.
