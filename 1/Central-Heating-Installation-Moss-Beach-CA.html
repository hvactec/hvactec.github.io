<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Moss Beach CA - Reasons Why You Would Need to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
