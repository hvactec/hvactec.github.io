<h3>Gas Furnace Service in Olathe KS</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
