<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
