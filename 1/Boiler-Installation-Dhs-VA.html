Expect to pay in between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to install central air if you do take our suggestion. Additionally, cooling contractors may charge an extra $50 to $200 for additional materials and devices.<p>
<p>If you notice a decrease in heat output, initially ensure the air filter is clean and in excellent condition. Next, inspect other parts of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, particles and dust, a low-cost fix that can help increase performance. Also, inspect the vents and ducts for obstruction. Finally, ensure the thermostat is working and located properly. Try moving it far from direct sunshine because this might impact temperature level readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature in your house. Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your home feeling cold if this takes place. You might also need to check your insulation to make sure that warm air does not leave from your space through different openings.<p>
