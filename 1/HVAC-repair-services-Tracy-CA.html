Required air heating systems tend to experience things like duct leakages, which rob them of up to 30% of their output. Forced air heating unit likewise tend to create hot and cold spots throughout the house, due to the nature of how warm air rises to the top of a room and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has identified building products, furnishings, and mold as severe issues, however much of the risk also originates from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially huge concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a harsh, terrible summertime.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Because it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you prior to you are aware it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild effects that are often mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, queasiness and fatigue. The impacts of CO exposure can vary significantly from individual to person depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
