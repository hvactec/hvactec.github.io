<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become blocked with particles that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to close down completely. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

Stagnant air may also be a problem when ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the variety of workers in the location.<p>
<p>Most people don't recognize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break over time. That can compromise the efficiency of the system and ultimately harm it enough that you require to purchase furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will carefully take a look at the connections and examine the performance of the system. They'll search for torn and damaged wires and change them in order to minimize the threat of fire and component failure.<p>
<p>The majority of HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that permit property owners to control the temperature and set it on a schedule. For example, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in house to conserve money on the energy costs and ensure the system isn't overburdened. A professional technician will examine the thermostat throughout the yearly maintenance to guarantee the actual temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. If there's a difference in the temperature level, the technician needs to check the thermostat's performance or assess the whole HVAC system.<p>
