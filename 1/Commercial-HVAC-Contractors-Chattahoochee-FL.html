Obviously, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year.

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
