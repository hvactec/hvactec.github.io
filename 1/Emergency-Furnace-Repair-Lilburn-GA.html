<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Lilburn GA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in house building and construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in roofs, floors, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices.

We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
