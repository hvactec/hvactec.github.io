<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.
