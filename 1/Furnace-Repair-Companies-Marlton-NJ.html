<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
