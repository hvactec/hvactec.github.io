<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything needs to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it becomes less effective.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This allows items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Place control includes moving the pollutant source away from residents and even transferring prone residents.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up simply a few years ago.<p>
