<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in covert or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
