<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
