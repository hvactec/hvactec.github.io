<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
