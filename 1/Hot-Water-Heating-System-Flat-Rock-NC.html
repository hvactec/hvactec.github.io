<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
