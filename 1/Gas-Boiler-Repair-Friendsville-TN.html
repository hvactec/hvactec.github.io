<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
