<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and really little particles of dust.

For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person ought to be called for almost any maintenance besides routine cleaning.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
