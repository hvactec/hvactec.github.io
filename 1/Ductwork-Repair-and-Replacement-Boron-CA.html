<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Boron CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
