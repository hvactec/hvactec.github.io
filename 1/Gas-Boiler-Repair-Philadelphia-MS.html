<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more affordable method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
