<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off.

Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
