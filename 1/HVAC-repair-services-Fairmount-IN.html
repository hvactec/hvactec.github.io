<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Because it just takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
