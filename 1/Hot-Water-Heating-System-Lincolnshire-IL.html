<p>While individuals invest 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has actually not been a large focus of attention for facilities management and tenants until just recently.

<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Lincolnshire IL</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of clinical evidence has indicated that the air within houses and other structures can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research study suggests that individuals invest roughly 90 percent of their time inside. Therefore, for many people, the dangers to health may be higher due to exposure to air pollution inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
