<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
