<h3>Furnace Installation Near me in North Wales PA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
