<h3>Facts All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Millwood KY</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
