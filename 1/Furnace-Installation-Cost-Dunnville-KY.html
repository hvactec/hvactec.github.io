<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
