<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by many public water materials, it has actually been found in well water.

<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
