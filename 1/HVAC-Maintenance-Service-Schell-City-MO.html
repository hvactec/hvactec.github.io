<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperatures in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside.

<p>Though it might be difficult to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are many other toxins that can not only filthy up the air, however result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure products add to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis might end up being clogged, minimizing air circulation distribution, volume, and quality. They likewise may become places for molds and germs to be and grow distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be properly kept to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
