<p>A customized ac system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air course. A basic a/c transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time.

Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
