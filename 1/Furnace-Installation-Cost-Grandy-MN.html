<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
