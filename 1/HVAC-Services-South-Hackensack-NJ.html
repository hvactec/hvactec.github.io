<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>

Individuals likewise react really in a different way to exposure to indoor air pollutants. More research study is needed to better comprehend which health effects occur after exposure to the average contaminant concentrations found in houses and which take place from the greater concentrations that occur for brief periods of time.<p>
