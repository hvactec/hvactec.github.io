<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.
