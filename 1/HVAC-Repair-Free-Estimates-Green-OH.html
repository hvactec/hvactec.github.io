<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
