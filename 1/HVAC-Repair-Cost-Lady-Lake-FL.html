<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Simply including refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. A trained technician needs to fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and effectiveness of your air conditioning system is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
