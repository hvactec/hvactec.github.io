<p>I typically don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances ought to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
