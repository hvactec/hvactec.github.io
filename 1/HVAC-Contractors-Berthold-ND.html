<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution.

Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
