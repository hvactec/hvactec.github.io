<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
