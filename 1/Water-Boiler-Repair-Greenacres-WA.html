<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
