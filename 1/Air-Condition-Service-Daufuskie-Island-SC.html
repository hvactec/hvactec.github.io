As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>The installation was quick, professional and effectively done. The installers were respectful and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize easily people who are good at what they do.

I very highly advise the two gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and efficiency if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
