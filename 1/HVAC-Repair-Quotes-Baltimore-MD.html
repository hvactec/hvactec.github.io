<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

Because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since a system is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big commercial and office complex such as skyscrapers and medical facilities, vehicles such as cars and trucks, trains, ships, airplanes and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with regard to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may notice musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak to your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house.
