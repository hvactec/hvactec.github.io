<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are utilized to seeing this enter the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling several spaces at once, but are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the house.
