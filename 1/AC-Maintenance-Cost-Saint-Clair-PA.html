<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>

<p>The primary health result related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
