<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become air-borne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
