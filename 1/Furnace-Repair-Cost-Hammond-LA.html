<p>Let's start by describing the planning that needs to happen before you actually buy a furnace. Choosing a furnace for your home isn't as easy as picking one off a display room flooring. Not all furnaces benefit all homes, and there are a couple of elements that definitely require to be thought about before choosing one. First, you'll need one that is properly sized for your house.

Before choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air gets away the system.<p>
