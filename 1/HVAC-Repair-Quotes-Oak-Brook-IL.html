<p>My oldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnÃ¢ $ t disperse air like it did previously. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t actually consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
