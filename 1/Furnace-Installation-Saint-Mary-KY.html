<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
