<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978.

In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, since the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything requires to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less efficient.
