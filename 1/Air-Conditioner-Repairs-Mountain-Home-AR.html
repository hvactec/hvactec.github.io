Soil by highways and roadways may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet prior to getting in the house. If you deal with lead in your task or a hobby, change your clothing before you go house and wash these clothing independently.
