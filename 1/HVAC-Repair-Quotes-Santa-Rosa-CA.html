<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Location the solar storage tank near the conventional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make certain that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
