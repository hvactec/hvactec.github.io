<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working.

<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Harwood Heights IL</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
