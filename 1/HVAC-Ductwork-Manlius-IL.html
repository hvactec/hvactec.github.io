<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>

However, assuming they are set up properly and properly taken care of, the likelihood of them having problems is small.<p>
