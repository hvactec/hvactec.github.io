Such a tool should identify the number of individuals affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they are located within the workplace; indicate when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of particular health signs or diseases; recognize all devices operated in the office; suggest the type of outdoors air pollution; and recognize potential sources of job stress.<p>
<p>Prior to you go out and buy an a/c, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the ac system be? Too large and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too small and your a/c won't be able to cool your house effectively. When shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will significantly impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to overlook any of them.<p>
