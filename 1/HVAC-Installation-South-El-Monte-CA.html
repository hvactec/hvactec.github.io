<h3>AC Compressor Repair in South El Monte CA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

<p>The main factor house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services provided. If the system is new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee, the cost might not be rewarding. Any significant repairs ought to be covered under the maker's service warranty.
