<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and signs up impact your comfort, they can likewise result in duct leaks due to extreme atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a good idea. You won't conserve any additional money and will end up causing more problems for your heating system.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required devices for the task. The bottom line?

There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
