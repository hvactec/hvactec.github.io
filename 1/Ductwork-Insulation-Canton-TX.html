<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Furnace in Canton TX</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home building is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofing systems. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
