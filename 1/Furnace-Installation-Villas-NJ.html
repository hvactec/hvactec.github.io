Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve).

If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
