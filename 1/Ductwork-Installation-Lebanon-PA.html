<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Lebanon PA - Reasons Why You Would Need to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>The majority of people do not know how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining pipes effectively, you'll have a water leakage. A limitation in your drain pipes triggers a water leak. There are many different places a blockage can take place. One of the primary locations where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
