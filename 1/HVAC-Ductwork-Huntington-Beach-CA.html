<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
