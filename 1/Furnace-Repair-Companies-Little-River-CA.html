<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
