He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it.
