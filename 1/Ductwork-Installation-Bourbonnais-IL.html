<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently might be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
