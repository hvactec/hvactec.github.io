<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Mobile AL</h3>
<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside. Many house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
