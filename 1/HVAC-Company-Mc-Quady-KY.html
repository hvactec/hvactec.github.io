<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time.

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Mc Quady KY</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not position the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools needed to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Over the past few years, there has been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been revealed to reduce levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is presently no proof, however, that a sensible number of houseplants remove significant amounts of pollutants in homes and offices. Indoor houseplants must not be over-watered because extremely moist soil might promote the development of bacteria which can affect allergic individuals.<p>
