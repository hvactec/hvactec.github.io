<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
