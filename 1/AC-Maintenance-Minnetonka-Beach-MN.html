<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical power, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors.
