<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>New a/c unit normally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER rating indicates higher energy performance and possibly lower energy expenses.

<p>Picking the best size ac system is a vital part of the HVAC buying process and one that you'll require an HVAC expert to assist you with.

<p>Particular kinds of HVAC units are a bit more expensive than wall units, ceiling or cassette units are neatly hidden inside the ceiling in the classroom and are for that reason more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to look at.
