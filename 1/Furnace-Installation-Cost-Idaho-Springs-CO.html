<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
