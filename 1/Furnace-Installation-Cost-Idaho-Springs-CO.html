<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
