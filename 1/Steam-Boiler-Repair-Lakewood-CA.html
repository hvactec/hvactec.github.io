<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the chances are excellent that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
