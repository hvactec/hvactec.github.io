<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
