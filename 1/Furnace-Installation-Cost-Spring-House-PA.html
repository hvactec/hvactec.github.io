<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Spring House PA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
