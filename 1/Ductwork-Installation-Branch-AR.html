<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
