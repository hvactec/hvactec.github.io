Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
