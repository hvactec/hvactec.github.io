Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet.

<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain poisonous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The main threat of mold growth, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More major than the majority of allergenic residential or commercial properties is the capability of mold to activate episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a severe breathing illness.<p>
