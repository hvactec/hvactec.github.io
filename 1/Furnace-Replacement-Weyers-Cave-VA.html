(If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys.
