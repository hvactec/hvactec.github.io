<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists used different approaches. The CMHC study called on several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they were part of a study, and the researchers did not manage for time invested or techniques used. The EPA research study recommended and managed methods used on a smaller sized number of houses. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research study has actually challenged the findings.

<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most budget friendly if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
