Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated house again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week!

<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Truth About Selecting Escondido CA HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We picked getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
