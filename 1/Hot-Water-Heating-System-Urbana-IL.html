<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
