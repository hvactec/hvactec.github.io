<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
