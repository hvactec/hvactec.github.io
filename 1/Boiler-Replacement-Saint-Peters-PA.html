<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
