<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often important to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
