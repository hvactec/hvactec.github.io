<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
