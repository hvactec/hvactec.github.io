<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
