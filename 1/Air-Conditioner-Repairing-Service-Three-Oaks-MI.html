<p>Current Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They met my needs totally by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is frequently essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can often be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent need to request that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this information may determine possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of information might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
