Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
