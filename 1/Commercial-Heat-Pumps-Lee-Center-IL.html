Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
