<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) is an essential problem in correction centers. It can directly impact the health and convenience of correctional officers and prisoners.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
