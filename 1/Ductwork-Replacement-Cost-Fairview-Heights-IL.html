<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor begins however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan begins. If  it does not, you have actually given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
