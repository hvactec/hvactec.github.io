We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
