<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price great however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Air pollutants can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air pollutant resulting from gas that leaves into your home without being burnt. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where moisture levels are typically greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
