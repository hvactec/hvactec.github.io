Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

However, choose your contractor carefully, a number of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners.
