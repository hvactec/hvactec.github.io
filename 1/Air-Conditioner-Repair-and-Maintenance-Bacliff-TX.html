<p>Chemical pollutants: Volatile natural substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the building (e.g., office devices; floor, wall and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
