<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern.
