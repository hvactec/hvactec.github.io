<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, homes and schools matters, especially because we spend the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not achieve a low humidity.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service.

You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the choices for your needs and you choose if you need it.<p>
