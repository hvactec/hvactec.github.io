<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them up until they have been effectively dried.
