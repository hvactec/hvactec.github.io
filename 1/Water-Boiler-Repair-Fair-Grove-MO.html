<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
