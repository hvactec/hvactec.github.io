<p>Nick B. supplied exceptional, personalized, mindful, and quality service. His communication style is friendly, appealing and effective. He plainly and thoroughly discussed all issues and repairs in a manner that made me positive in his ability to fix my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my partner and I would not have to endure another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in current memory. He also reacted to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to a problem that couldn't be dealt with on the very first visit due to unavailable parts.

<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract attempts to upsell you whenever they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months prior to the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
