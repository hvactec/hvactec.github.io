<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.
