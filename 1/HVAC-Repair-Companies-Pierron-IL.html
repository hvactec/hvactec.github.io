<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install assessment outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
