<h3>Home Furnace in Sedalia NC</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC man and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
