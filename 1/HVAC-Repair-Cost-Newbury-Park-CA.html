<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically brought on by the absence of adequate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in majority the workplace indoor air investigations it has conducted.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, many of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The majority of companies use 3rd party service warranty companies - not YORK. YORK items are backed by some of the very best limited guarantees in business, including YORK's factory-backed guarantee.
