<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary liberty.
