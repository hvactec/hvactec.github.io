<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time.

We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
