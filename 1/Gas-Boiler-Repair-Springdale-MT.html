<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
