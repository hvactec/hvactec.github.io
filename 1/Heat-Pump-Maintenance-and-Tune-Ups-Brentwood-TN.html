<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Brentwood TN</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building materials, furnishings, and household items like air fresheners, release contaminants more or less constantly. Other sources, related to activities carried out in the home, release contaminants intermittently. These consist of cigarette smoking, using unvented or malfunction-ing ranges, heating systems, or space heaters, using solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, the use of paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and making use of cleaning products and pesticides in housekeeping. High toxin concentrations can remain in the air for extended periods after some of these activities.<p>
