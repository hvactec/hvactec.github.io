<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
