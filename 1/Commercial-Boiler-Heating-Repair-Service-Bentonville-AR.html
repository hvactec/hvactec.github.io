While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room.

Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and methods used by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed considering that these research studies were carried out, the duct in houses have not.<p>
