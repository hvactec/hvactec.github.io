<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Welches OR</h3>
<p>When temperatures outside start to heat up, you rely on your air conditioner to cool you cool. But in order to keep a comfortable indoor environment, you require every component of your cooling system to be working its best. So if your system needs a new compressor, rely on our team for help.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
