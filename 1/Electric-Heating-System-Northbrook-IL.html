Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal.
