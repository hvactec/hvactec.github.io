This is generally utilized in a second or third-floor  location and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
