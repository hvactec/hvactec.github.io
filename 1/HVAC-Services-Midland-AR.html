These convection heating units are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just radiant systems.

When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
