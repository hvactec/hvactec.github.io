<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators.

This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
