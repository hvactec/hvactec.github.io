<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
