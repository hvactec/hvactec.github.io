<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
