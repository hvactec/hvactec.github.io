<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues in houses.

High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in effectiveness advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because an unit is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
