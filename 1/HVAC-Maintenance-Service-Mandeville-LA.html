<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in many cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works however your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
