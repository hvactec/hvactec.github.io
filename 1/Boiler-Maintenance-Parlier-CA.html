<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
