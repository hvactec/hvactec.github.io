<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
