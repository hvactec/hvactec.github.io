<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room.
