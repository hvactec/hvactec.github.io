<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Santa Fe Springs California</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by numerous thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very vital to preserving an appropriate temperature level.<p>
<p>In some cases an old air conditioning system needs to be replaced for cost, efficiency, or other reasons. However, selecting an a/c is never a one-size-fits-all situation. Our AC pros come to your house to determine exactly which air conditioning unit will work best for you.
