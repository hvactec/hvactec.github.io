<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing combines quality items and impressive service with innovation and technological advances to provide high-performance cooling and heating items worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external unit. In the outside system of this air conditioning system there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking a number of traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems located in the room.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges utilized poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
