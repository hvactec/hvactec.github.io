<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.

That said, property buyers wanting to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heating system will be willing to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
