<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being blocked with debris that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down completely. By comparison, changing a furnace and examining filter can usually be carried out in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools needed.

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
