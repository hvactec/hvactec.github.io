<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is developed for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists concerned with indoor air quality. Our specialists describe all of your alternatives prior to starting the repair, so you can choose whether a repair or replacement is best for you. Our No Surprises Pricing-- consisting of charging by the job, not by the hour-- means the cost we quote you is the price you pay. If you decide that changing your furnace is the very best course of action, we can set up a brand-new, high-efficiency design in its location.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and normally some other benefits. Some companies provide priority consultations to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
