<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer contracts.. The so called trustworthy companies dupe more individuals than the fly by night clothing. I know since I tried to work for them. Because 90% of them are crooks, I give up. They walk in with or without an agreement and start selling you things you don't need. They lie. How do I know.
