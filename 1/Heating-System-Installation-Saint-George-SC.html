<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold growth and ought to be disposed of. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in covert or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
