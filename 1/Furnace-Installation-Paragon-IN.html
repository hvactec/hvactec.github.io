<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
