<h3>Facts All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Brighton CO</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require reasonably little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is vital to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank should be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed regularly to eliminate tank and collected pollutants (scaling in hard water locations). The systems should be inspected a minimum of twice annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Once every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you ought to get your HVAC system aesthetically inspected at least. This inspection is an essential element of HVAC maintenance.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
