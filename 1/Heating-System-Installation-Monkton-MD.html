<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
