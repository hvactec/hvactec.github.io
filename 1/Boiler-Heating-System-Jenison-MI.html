<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Jenison MI</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as skilled as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system prior to you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
