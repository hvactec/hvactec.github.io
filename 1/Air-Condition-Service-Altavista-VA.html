<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 need to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
