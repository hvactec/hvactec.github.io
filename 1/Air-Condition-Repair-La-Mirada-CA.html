<p>Air contaminants can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant arising from gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are normally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances are there will be mold growing nearby. Repair the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
