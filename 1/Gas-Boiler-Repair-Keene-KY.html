<p>Chemical pollutants: Unstable organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; furnishings, flooring and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
