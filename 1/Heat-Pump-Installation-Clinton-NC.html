PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
