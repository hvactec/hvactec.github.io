<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>As you normally need to apply a self-leveling substance on top of the electric underfloor heating unit, you must factor in the time it takes for this to completely dry before the flooring covering can be put in place - this is generally a day or two.

<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power relies on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a trusted and readily available source of energy.<p>
