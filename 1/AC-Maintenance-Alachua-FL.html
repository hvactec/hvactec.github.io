<p>When installing radiant heating, you need to provide serious idea to the type of floor covering in the house. Because it carries out and stores heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work fairly well. Carpeting will directly insulate the flooring from the space, decreasing effectiveness, so if you wish to set up carpet in a radiant-heated space, use a thin carpet with dense cushioning.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
