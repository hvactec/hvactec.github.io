<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
