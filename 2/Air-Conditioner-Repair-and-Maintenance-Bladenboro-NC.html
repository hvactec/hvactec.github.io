<p>There are many actions a property owner can take to select products that will prevent indoor air problems from happening - a number of them are discussed here. Initially, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about utilizing solid wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet.
