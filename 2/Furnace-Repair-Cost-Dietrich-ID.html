<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years back and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
