<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
