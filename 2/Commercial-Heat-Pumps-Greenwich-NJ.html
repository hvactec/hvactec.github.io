At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any concerns or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where appropriate.<p>

This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
