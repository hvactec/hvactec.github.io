<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
