<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and treat-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
