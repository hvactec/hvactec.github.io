<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor.
