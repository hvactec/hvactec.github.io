<p>A geothermal heating system does not produce its power by burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or oil. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. Additionally, a geothermal heating and cooling system uses substantially less electrical power compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heater an attractive option to cut your carbon footprint, offering a favorable influence on the environment.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Specialists suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and usually are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
