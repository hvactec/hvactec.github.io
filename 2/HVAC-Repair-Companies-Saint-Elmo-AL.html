<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Saint Elmo Alabama</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that provide gas to your furnace need to also be inspected frequently. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire threat.

Water can likewise puddle around the unit or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
