If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square video alone, relocate to another contractor. Just like determining the size of an unit required based on BTUs, identifying the right size of system for your home likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
