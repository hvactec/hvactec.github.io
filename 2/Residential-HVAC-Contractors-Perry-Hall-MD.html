<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes.

If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
