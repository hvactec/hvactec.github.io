<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>We advise using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money.

By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
