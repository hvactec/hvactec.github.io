Source control, filtration and making use of ventilation to dilute contaminants are the main approaches for improving indoor air quality in the majority of structures.

<p>Our indoor air quality specialists can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.

Such factors include making use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide emitted by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls consisted of in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
