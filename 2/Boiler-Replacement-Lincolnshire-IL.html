<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
