<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
