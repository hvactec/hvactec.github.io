Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
