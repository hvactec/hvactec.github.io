A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
