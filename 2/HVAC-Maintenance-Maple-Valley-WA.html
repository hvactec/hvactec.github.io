The majority of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors eliminate contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they must be positioned. A lot of typically they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if people primarily stay seated in that specific location. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what toxin you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensor appropriately. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside buildings are generally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
