<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
