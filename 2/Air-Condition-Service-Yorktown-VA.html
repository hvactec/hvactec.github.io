<h3>How To Pick An HVAC Company at Yorktown VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Numerous aspects impact IAQ. These elements include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), issues controlling temperature, low or high humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air coming into the building. In some cases, particular pollutants like dust from building or remodelling, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals released as a gas with time) may trigger bad IAQ.<p>
