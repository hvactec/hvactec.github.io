<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
