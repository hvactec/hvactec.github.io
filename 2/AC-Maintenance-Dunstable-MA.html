<p>Since an ac system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
