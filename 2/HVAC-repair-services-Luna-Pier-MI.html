<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
