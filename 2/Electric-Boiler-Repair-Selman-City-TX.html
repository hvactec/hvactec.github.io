I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
