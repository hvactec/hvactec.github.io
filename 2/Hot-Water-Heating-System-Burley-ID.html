The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Filters can get dirty easily, especially if you reside in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned up and changed regularly. The heating and cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will worsen. Inspecting and altering the air filters is one of the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
