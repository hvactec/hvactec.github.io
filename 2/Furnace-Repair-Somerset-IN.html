<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold enjoy wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other irritants under control.

Air-side economizers likewise utilize outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
