<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractors in West Union</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Commercial HVAC in West Union South Carolina</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>

<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System at West Union SC</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
