<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial cost of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout new building and construction (houses generally utilize between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
