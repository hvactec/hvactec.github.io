<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Bent Mountain VA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
