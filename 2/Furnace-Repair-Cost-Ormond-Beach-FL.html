<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx clients don't know why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. American Requirement a/c unit are one of the best central air conditioning brand names in the business. The typical cost to set up a 14 SEER American Requirement AC system would be around $2,600 to $3,200.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint products, and vehicle emissions in attached garages.
