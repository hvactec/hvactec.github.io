<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
