Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

After that, you can make a much better ideal decision on how typically your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll need to clean them.
