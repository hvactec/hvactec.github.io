<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your North Palm Springs CA Home</h3>
<p>Having a wood-burning heating system can be incredibly efficient in terms of cost. If you have access to free or cheap firewood, or you cut your own wood from your timber, it might not cost you anything. Sadly, wood-burning heater require a very important natural deposit: wood!

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
