Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
