<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
