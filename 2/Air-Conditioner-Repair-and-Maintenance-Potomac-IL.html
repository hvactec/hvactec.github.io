Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on.

The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
