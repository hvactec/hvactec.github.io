The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system.

Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not basic, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
