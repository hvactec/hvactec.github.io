<p>A customized air conditioning system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
