Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
