<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
