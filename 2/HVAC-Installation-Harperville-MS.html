<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Harperville MS</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
