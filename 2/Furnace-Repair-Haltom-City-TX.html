<p>There are lots of reasons that this can happen. The good news is that you can address many of these factors by yourself without the need to require professional aid. Start by opening the heat registers and after that carry on to checking the thermostat settings. Next, examine the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
