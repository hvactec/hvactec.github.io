<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it may be wiser to change the entire system.<p>
