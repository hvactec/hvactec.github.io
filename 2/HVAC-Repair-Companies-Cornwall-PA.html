<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
