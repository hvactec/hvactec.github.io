This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing.

<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Evanston IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
