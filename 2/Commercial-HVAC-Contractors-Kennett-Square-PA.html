<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being blocked with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down totally. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be done in just a couple of minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
