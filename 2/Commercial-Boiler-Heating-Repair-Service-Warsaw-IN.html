<p>We look at clues before we supply guidance to change instead of repair a heater. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video. They use a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs required to heat the area. The larger the area, the more effective the house heater requires to be. For already constructed house heating unit, the contractor will need to eliminate the old furnace to add the new one. These charges will be included in the installation costs.<p>
