<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
