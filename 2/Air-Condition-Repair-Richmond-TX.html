The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future.

This last check may mention faults in the thermostat, which may be as basic as a need to replace batteries. A failure to switch on might simply involve a tripped circuit breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician discusses any concerns or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where proper.<p>
