<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced.

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
