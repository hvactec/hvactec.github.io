<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Rosemount MN</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
