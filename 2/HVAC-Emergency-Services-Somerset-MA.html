EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies further details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.
