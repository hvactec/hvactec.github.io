Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00.

<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
