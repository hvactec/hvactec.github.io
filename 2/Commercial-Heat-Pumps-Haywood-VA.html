Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a really comfy temperature level.
