<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment.
