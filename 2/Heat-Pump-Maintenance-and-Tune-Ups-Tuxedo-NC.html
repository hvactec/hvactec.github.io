<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of furnaces have multiple control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t correctly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
