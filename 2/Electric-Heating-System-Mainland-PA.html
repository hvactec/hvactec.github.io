<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Mainland PA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Ventilation, heating, and air conditioning (HVAC) 1 is the innovation of car and indoor environmental convenience. Its goal is to supply thermal convenience and appropriate indoor air quality HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, based upon the principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and heat transfer" Refrigeration" is in some cases added to the field's abbreviation, as HVAC&R or HVACR or "ventilation" is dropped, as in HACR (as in the classification of HACR-rated circuit breakers ).<p>
