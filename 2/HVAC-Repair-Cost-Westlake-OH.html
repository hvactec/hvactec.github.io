<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
