The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

Obstructions can obstruct the circulation of condensed water and cause wetness build-up within the system. Excess wetness can cause issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, uneven temperature regulation, germs, and compromised air quality.
