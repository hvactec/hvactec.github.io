<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

This suggests it can heat up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
