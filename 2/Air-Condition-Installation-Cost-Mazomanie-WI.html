Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product.

<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the main issue in more than half the office indoor air investigations it has actually performed. Examinations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the exact same to be real. These investigations revealed that correct ventilation is necessary in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>

<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
