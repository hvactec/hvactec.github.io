<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
