<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Improper adjustment, often shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue.

Never ever use a gas stove to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
