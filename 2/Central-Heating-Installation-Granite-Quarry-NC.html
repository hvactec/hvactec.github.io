<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for bids. While both were valuable and helpful, Ballard Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and located methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these considerable but small changes in his quote. Because of recent warmer summers and for ecological factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
