<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for bids. While both were valuable and helpful, Ballard Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and located methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these considerable but small changes in his quote. Because of recent warmer summers and for ecological factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>

<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations.

Before it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gas, water pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation.
