<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.
