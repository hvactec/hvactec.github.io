<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
