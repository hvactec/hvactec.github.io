<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
