<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price.
