<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience periodic periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Turn off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work properly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
