<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Lacoochee FL</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
