<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
