<h3>Furnace Service in Homestead FL</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
