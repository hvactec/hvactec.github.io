The typical summer season temperature to arrive at the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to reach the appropriate SEER rating for your area, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83.

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
