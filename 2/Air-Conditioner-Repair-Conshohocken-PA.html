<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely thorough in discussing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn provided terrific customer care at the end of the visit by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
