<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
