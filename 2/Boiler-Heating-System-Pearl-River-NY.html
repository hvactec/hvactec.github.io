<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Pearl River NY Home Owners</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be properly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly.
