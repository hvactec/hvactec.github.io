Among the primary areas where clogs begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
