<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad.

Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively.

Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
