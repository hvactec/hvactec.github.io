<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, fetuses, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
