<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
