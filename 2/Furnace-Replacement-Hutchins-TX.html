<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
