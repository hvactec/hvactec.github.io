<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually identified the problem location in looking over the expense. He dealt with the problem in one day, had actually changed the bill to what I considered reasonable prior to he recalled, knew what may have triggered the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have actually used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities.

The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the extremely hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
