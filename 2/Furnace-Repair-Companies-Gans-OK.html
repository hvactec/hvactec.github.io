<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter season can exacerbate problems. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too chilly to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be familiar with a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be prowling in your environments.<p>

Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later on in this area.<p>
