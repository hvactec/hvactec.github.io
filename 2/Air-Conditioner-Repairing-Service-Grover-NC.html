<p>Customer products which contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to trigger cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can trigger signs associated with exposure to carbon monoxide.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
