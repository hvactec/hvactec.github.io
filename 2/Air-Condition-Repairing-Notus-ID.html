<p>Particular immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically tough to determine if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is essential to take notice of the time and place the signs happen. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some impacts might be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the heating, humidity, or cooling conditions prevalent in the house.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
