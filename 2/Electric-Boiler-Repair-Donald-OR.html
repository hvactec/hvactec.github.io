<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%.

Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not simple, considering that it considers not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
