<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work properly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
