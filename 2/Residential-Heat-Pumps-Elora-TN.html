Not only was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
