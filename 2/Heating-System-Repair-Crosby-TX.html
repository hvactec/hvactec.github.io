Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>
