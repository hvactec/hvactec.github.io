Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

<p>When setting up the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
