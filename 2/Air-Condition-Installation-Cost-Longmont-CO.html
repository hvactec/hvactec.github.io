<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for many years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly seem greater than normal, it is probably time to consider a new system. New heating equipment is much more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to mention the cash you'll minimize repair costs. You can probably anticipate to cut your fuel expenses in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives normally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial cost of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new building (homes normally utilize between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>

When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of workers in the location, stale air might also be an issue.<p>
