<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
