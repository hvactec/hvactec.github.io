The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
