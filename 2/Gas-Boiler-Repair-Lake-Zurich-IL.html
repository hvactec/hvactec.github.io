<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is frequently important to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping track of data is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information may determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
