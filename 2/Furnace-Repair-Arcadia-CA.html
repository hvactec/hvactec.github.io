<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to thaw your cooling devices. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
