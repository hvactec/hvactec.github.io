<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
