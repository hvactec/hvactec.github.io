<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
