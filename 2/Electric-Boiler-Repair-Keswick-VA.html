<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>The primary factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services used. The cost may not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's guarantee. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the maker's warranty. However, some manufacturers need regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Often a temporary indoor air quality issue is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated problems-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the problem you're experiencing, among the 3 techniques listed below may be proper.<p>
