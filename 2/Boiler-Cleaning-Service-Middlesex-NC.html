Newer gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
