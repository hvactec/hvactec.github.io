<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at sensible energy expenses. Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone, transfer to another contractor.
