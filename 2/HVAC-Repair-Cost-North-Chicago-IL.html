<p>Professional heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists advise following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heating unit) with the same quantity of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
