<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
