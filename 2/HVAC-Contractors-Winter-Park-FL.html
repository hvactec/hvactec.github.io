<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work effectively in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electricity, a heat pump is a cost-efficient solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>For instance, impurities may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption lies near a source of wetness or other outdoor pollutant, it may function as a pathway to bring the impurities inside.

During high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
