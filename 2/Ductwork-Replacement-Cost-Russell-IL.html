<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
