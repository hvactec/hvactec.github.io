<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My wife said that she had actually seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a long time.
