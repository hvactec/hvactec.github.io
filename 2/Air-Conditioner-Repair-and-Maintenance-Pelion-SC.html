<p>Sean was very useful. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor.

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an uncommonly high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had identified the problem location in examining the costs. He dealt with the issue in one day, had adjusted the expense to what I considered fair before he recalled, understood what might have triggered the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not happen once again.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
