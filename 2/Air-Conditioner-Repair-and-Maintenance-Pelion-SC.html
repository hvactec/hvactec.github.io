<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
