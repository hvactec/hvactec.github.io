<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
