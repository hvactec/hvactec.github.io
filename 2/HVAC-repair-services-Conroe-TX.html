<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that best temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which usually consists of a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
