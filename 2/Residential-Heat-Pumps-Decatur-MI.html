There can be a serious threat from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to minimize the danger from existing sources and to prevent new problems from taking place.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw.
