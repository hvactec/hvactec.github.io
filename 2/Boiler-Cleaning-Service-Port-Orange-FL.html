<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces at Port Orange FL</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by lots of individuals.<p>
