<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at La Vergne TN</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Both should be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
