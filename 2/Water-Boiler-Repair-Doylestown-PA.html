<p>Oil heaters are usually not really effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however a lot of do not achieve an effectiveness greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.

<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
