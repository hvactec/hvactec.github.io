<h3>Heater Repair in Fountain Hills AZ</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to evaluate scenario & decided to go with them for the work. I more than happy to state that not just did we get the central air going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were extremely expert, courteous and the work was really effectively done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>We take a look at hints before we offer guidance to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>We have actually been using Keefe's for years and have constantly been incredibly pleased. They provide outstanding repair install and the customer care is wonderful. We recently had an issue with an older unit and called to set up a day and time to have it inspected. They sent out James Bell and he was great. He took the time to explain our alternatives cost distinctions and was extremely educated expert and helpful. Happy customers. " Mathew Licausi.<p>
