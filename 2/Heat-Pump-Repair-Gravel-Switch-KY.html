<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in Gravel Switch</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit. Loose, missing or defective wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves examining the advised connections as well as temperature and pressure evaluates. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are safe and tight.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything needs to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less effective. Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps typically last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last as much as twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its expected life-span, replacement might be the most cost-efficient service.<p>
