<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
