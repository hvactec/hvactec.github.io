<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, much of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Over the previous couple of years, there has actually been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have actually been shown to decrease levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is presently no proof, however, that a reasonable variety of houseplants get rid of significant quantities of toxins in offices and houses. Because extremely damp soil might promote the growth of microorganisms which can impact allergic individuals, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
