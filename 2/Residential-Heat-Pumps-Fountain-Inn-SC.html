<p>All Points Heating offers house a/c, air conditioner installation, air conditioning system maintenance that provide trusted, proven efficiency at high efficiency. Combustion items from automobile exhaust, furnaces, hot water heater, area heating units, aromatic candle lights, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not effectively vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC man and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
