Radiators can be locally located in one area like a restroom floor or be set up throughout the entire sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>

Electric heating systems start at $395 and range up to $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>
