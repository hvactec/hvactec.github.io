<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Mountainburg Arkansas</h3>
<p>When central air service fails during a heat spell, you might need to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to appear, and you'll probably pay at least a number of hundred for the repair.

Frequently found office contaminants and their sources. consist of ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building products; formaldehyde from pressed wood products; other organics from building materials, carpet, and other workplace furnishings, cleaning activities and products, bathroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and printing shop; biological impurities from dirty ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>

<h3>Discontinue Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Mountainburg AR</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
