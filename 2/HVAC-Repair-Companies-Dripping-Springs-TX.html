<p>I have actually been using them for years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC person and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
