<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

In turn, the things in the room, like furniture and individuals, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
