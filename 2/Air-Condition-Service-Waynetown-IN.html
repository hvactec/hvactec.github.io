<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their total power ought to not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, because the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, considering that it considers not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
