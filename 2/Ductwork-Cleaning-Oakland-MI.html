<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a referral later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
