<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
