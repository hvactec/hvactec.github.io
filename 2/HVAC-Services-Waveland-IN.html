Setups can likewise vary significantly, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be done in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed.
