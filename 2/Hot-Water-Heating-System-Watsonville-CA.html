<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical approach of reducing exposure to indoor air toxins, also will decrease but not remove direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Mechanical or natural ventilation methods do not eliminate them from the air in your home as quickly as they construct up since cigarette smoking produces such large quantities of pollutants. In addition, the big increases in ventilation it takes to substantially minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs significantly.

Examinations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the exact same to be true. These examinations exposed that correct ventilation is necessary in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Use professionals and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated specialists perform far better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
