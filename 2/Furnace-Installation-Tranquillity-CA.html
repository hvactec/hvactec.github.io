<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible most of the times, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores. The primary hazard of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than many allergenic homes is the capability of mold to set off episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a severe breathing disease.<p>
<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's important that it's sized properly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too small, then your house will not be heated up sufficiently and the system will have to continuously go to try to heat the whole house, which will increase heating costs.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time.
