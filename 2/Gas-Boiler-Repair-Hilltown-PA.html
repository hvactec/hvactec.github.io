<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
