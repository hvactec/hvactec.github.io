<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
