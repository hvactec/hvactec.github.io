<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at house over the weekend. Place control involves moving the toxin source far from residents and even moving vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was type of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved issues. I would advise this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outside air that must be continually supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
