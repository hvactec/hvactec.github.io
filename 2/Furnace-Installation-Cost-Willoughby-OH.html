<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
