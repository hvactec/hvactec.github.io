<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
