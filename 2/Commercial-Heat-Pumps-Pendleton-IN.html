Permeable products, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours might end up being a source for mold growth and should be discarded. In some cases there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in covert or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
