<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements.
