<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
