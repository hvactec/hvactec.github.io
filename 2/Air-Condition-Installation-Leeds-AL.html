They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to purchase it. My partner said that she had actually seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have actually fulfilled in a long period of time.
