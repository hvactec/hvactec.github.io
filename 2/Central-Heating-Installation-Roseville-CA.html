<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow limitation will lower the system's effectiveness.
