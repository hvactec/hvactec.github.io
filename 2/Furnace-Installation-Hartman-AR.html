<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Hartman AR</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on different house performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was outstanding. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the necessary electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
