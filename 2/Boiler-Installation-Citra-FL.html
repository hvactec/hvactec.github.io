If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
