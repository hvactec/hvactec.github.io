<p>Central air units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you require clearness on this issue, contact one of our technicians.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions.
