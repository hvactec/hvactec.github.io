<p>Central air units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to explain brief biking in very cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the really low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will merely run harder to keep a warm environment for your home when the weather condition is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you require clearness on this issue, contact one of our technicians.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions.
