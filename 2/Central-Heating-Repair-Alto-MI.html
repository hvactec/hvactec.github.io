<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 ought to be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
