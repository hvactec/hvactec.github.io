<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might see musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>

Auto parts producers, aerospace makers and car producers are all within a few cents of each other at around $31 per hour, or over $64,000 per year. Railways are another high-wage company, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 per year.<p>
