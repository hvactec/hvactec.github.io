<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>Mobile houses are normally smaller sized than stick-built properties and use substantially less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat.

Bear in mind that not as lots of brand names produce oil heaters for this use, and you may find more choices with gas, propane, or electric heating systems.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
