<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
