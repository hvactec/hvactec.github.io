<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a cruel, cruel summer.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth does not necessarily translate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The air, ventilation and heating conditioning service tends to run cold and hot. When clients require their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather shows up, need heats up throughout the summer season and winter season.<p>
