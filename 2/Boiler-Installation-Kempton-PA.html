<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in terms of ecological costs.

While geothermal systems do use some electricity, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other toxins than heater that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
