Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.

When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.

When the air conditioner works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
