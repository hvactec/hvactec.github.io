<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Barling AR</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
