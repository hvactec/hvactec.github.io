<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
