<p>A specific a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air course. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the space because its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, given that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of.

<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
