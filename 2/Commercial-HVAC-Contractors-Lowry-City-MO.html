<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that ideal temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service strategy which generally includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Many companies use 3rd party service warranty companies - not YORK. YORK products are backed by a few of the best minimal guarantees in business, including YORK's factory-backed guarantee.
