<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside.
