But many of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their homes and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than models made 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years old or older.
