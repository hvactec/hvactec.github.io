<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Spring Mount PA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good possibility; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual events.<p>
