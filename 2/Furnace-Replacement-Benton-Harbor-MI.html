However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to supply thermal convenience indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness indoors is associated with a greater prevalence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
