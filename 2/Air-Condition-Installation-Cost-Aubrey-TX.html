<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has become an important concern to house owners and health specialists. Indoor air contamination studies have identified a number of pollutants that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion products, unstable natural compounds (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these impurities are necessary in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit makers generally make rugged, high quality products. Start by examining any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool down for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
