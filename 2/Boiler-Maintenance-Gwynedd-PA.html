<p>New air conditioning unit usually vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER ranking implies higher energy efficiency and potentially lower energy expenses.

It's not constantly about selecting the model with the greatest SEER ranking, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
