<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Butler MD</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
