<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
