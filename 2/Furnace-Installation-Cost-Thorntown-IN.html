<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
