<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in North Webster IN?</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the required electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>

<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
