<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>Radiant heat provides a number of special benefits over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.
