<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
