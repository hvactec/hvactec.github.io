<p>The icing problem ends up being a lot more extreme with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are typically set up in tandem with a more standard form of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Both should be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
