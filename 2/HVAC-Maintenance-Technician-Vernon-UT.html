As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>How to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Vernon UT</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
