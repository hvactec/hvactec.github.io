<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially costly to set up, particularly in an older house. Depending on the type of unit installed, it can be noisy and trigger issues if you're extremely adverse dust. Additionally, specific fuels and devices may need special permits, and there is minimal flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. During usage, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year.

Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose inflammation.

<p>The primary reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services provided.
