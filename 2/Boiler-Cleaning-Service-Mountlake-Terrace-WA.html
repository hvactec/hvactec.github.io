<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, rather than commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure.
