<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we fixed concerns. I would suggest this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time.

<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological contaminants are wet or wet structure products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness brought on by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Numerous fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and family plants.<p>

<p>Brian was every bit sincere, responsive and enjoyable. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing discussed our options prior to our work with Brian and was incredible, valuable and useful - his work was remarkable! All of his assistants were polite and diligent. The work site was left utterly cleared and cleaned up. We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Cooling for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years back and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation handbook and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. A lot of systems include a package that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will ensure a safe and airtight  fit in the window opening. And for extra assistance, especially for larger ac system, consider purchasing a steel assistance bracket and mount it to the outside home wall, straight below the windowsill.<p>
