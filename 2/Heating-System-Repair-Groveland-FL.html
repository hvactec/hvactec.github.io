<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
