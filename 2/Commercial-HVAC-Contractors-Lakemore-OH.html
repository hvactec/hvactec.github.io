<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could flatter twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of 30 days during which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 last year! Just a few years ago, Seattle saw a record temperature level of 103 degrees, and there have been a lot of long, dry, hot streaks ever since. When the heat gets intolerable, a central air conditioning system in your house suggests you have the power to adjust the temperature to a constant temperature level.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Lakemore OH</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
