<p>It's not recommended for uncertified people to repair & inspect cooling & HVAC devices. There is a danger of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups.

When inspecting your air conditioning equipment to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, constantly make sure.
