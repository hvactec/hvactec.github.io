<p>It's not recommended for uncertified people to repair & inspect cooling & HVAC devices. There is a danger of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. If you left it to an experienced ac repair Houston Midtown tech for proper HVAC medical diagnosis, it would be best. When inspecting your air conditioning equipment to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, constantly make sure. Be really careful when examining capacitors, even with the air conditioning system off. Capacitors can hold a high voltage charge, even with the power switched off. An unanticipated discharge from an air conditioning capacitor can cause severe injury or death.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's important that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced.
