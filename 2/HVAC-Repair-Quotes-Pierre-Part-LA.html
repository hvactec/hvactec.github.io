<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic duty clause" applies. This clause, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, specifies that a company must provide a healthy and safe work environment. Thus, making sure the air is of great quality is the employer's task.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have actually been completed, the last job is to test the system to ensure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This last check may explain faults in the thermostat, which may be as basic as a requirement to change batteries. A failure to switch on might simply involve a tripped circuit breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any concerns or problems and makes suggestions about upgrades where proper.<p>
