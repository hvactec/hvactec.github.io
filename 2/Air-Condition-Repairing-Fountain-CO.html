<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Fountain Colorado</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
