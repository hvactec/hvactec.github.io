<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump run on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
