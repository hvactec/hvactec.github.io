<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil.
