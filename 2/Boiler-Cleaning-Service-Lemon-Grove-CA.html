<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
