Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been connected to signs like headaches, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Also, some specific diseases have been linked to particular air contaminants or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause instant symptoms however can cause cancer after several years.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other types of heatpump, have effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a scientific method of identifying just how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. The majority of geothermal heat pump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for every single unit of energy used to power the system, 3 to 5 units are provided as heat.<p>
