<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My partner stated that she had actually seen a great review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a long time. We need to support the genuine people who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
