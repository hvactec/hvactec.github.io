<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor pollutants.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
