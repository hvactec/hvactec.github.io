<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractors in Merrimac</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Heating systems that kick on regularly might be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
