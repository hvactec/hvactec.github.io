<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for many years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly seem greater than typical, it is most likely time to think about a new system. New heating devices is even more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel costs right now, not to discuss the cash you'll minimize repair costs.

<p>A regular furnace tune up can optimize effectiveness and offer longer long lasting house heating.

The decision to repair or replace is up to you, and frequently it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely offers greater energy performance and comes with warranty protection.<p>

<p>Radiant heater do not utilize ducts, that makes them quite a bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also do not develop cold and hot areas.
