<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may see musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your medical professional about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically vital to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent need to request that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this information might identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
