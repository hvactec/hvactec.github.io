Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the very same time, because the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfy temperature level.

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
