<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>A third method to choose whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your house may not have adequate ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To identify smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold development and ought to be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in concealed or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
