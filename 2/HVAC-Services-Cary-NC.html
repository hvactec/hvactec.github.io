<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
