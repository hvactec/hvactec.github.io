<p>Air toxins can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air contaminant resulting from natural gas that gets away into your house without being burned off.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
