<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
