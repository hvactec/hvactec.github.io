<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might notice moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk to your medical professional about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
