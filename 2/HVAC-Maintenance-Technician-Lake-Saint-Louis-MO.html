<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Lake Saint Louis Missouri</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the centers managers who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service came to us for that reason. Usually they were at first interested in remotely keeping an eye on some other aspect of their structures, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't up until later on, as they continued working with us, that they found out about and executed indoor air quality keeping an eye on to offer a much healthier, safer building environment-- and to avoid the negative consequences associated with indoor air toxins.<p>

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>

Bacteria or micro-organisms might likewise be present within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire workplace or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
