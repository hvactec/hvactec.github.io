<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a few years back.<p>
