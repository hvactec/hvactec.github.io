<h3>HVAC Supply in Redan GA</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
