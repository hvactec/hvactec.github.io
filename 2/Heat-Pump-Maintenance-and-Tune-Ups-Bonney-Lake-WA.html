<p>The majority of people don't understand how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the wet hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC system is not draining effectively. A restriction in your drain pipes triggers a water leak. There are several locations a clog can happen. Among the main areas where clogs begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Air conditioner service consultations consist of a long list of checks in, on and around your equipment. Knoechel Heating Company experts will look at things that might be making your AC run inefficiently, such as refrigerant charge.
