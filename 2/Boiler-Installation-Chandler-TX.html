<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Chandler TX</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
