<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>

If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
