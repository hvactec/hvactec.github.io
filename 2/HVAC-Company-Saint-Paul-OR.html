<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") describes how within air can affect a person's capability, health, and comfort to work.

For instance, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in home to conserve money on the energy costs and make sure the system isn't overburdened. A professional technician will check the thermostat throughout the yearly maintenance to ensure the actual temperature level and the temperature on the thermostat matches.
