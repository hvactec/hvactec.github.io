<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.
