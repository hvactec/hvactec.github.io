<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
