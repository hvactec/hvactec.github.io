<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
