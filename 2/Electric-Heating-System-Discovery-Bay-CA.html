<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>I have had the satisfaction of working with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly 10 years and during that time, they have always supplied excellent service. Everyone I have actually dealt with is professional and friendly. The techs are prompt, considerate and effective. They strive to finish every task as rapidly as possible and comprehend our monetary requirements on all five of the commercial residential or commercial properties on which I help with the management.<p>
<p>Additionally, homeowners have a range of options to select from in powering a floor heater. Radiant systems work with electrical, natural gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As numerous homeowners are all too aware, tradition furnace systems are usually restricted to running on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the marketplace for that energy source turns unstable, rates can change, rates increase and you can end up paying more to heat your house despite how low you set your thermostat.<p>
