<p>Compounding the noted health symptoms might be task tension. In part, due to different aspects of workplace automation, the most stressful elements of workplace work are increasing. Health symptoms related to task tension consist of mental and physical stress such as frustration, stress and anxiety, irritability, anger, depression, stomach or gastro-intestinal disturbances, and muscle and mental tension. These signs may be promoted by poor indoor quality.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. Many modern-day hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
