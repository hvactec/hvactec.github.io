<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same).

<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for property owners to think about.

Packaged systems are great for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.

For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
