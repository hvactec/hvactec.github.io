<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly might end up being stopped up, reducing air circulation quality, volume, and distribution. They likewise may become places for molds and germs to be and grow distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise should be properly preserved to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who described our options did an exceptional task in making certain we comprehended the benefits and drawbacks of each choice.
