<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time.

We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
