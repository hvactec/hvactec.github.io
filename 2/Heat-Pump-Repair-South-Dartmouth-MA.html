<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
