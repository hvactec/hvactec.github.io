<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor toxins emitted by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside your home might trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
