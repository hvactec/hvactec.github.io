<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is truthful, reputable, and affordable on cost. It's tough to discover a truthful AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
