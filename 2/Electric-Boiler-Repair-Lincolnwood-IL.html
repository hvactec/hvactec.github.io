<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
