So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it because it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will lower the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in large commercial structures can not be successfully recognized or remedied without an extensive structure investigation. These investigations may start with composed questionnaires and telephone consultations in which structure private investigators evaluate the history of occupant symptoms and building operation treatments. Sometimes, these queries may quickly discover the issue and on-site check outs are unneeded.<p>
