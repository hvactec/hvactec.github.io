Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
