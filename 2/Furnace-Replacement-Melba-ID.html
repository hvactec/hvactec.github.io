Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has been running problem free for the past 2+ years.
