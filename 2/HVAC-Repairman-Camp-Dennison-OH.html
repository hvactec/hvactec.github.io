Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure.
