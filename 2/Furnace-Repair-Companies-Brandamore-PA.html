<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
