<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold growth and must be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
