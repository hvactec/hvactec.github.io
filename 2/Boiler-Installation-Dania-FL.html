For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
