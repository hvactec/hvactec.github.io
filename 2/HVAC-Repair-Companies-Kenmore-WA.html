<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of outdoor or commercial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>Air conditioning and refrigeration are provided through the elimination of heat. Heat can be eliminated through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as refrigerants A refrigerant is employed either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is utilized to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a complimentary cooling system which utilizes pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (typically water or a glycol mix).<p>

PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
