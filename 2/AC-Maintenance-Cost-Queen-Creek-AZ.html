<p>Heating systems as they age run the risk of developing fractures in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide gas, if present, might leakage into your home undetected. Indications of this may be regular headaches, a burning feeling in nose or eyes, queasiness, disorientation, flu-like signs.

<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>Typically the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions.
