<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Geothermal air conditioning is a cost-efficient and clever way to cool down your house or place of business when the temperature levels keep climbing.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
