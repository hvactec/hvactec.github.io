<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than commercial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>For instance, issues occur when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate sufficient quantities of outside air.

Improperly situated outside air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological impurities that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
