<p>The main factor homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services offered. The cost might not be beneficial if the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's warranty. Any significant repairs should be covered under the maker's warranty. However, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
