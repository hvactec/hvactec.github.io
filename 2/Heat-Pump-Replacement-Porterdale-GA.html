The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract..
