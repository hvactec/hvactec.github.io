<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%.
