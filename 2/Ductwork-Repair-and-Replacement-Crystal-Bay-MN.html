<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
