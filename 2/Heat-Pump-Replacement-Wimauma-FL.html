<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for years.

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold.

Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
