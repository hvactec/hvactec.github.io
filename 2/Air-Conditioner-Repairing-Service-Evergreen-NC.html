<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an option for house owners to think about. Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best choice for homeowners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
