<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>HVAC System in King Of Prussia PA</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
