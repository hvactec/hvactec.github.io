<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Bear in mind that the SEER score is determined utilizing the same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The typical summer season temperature to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to get to the proper SEER ranking for your location, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all brand-new a/c systems manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
