<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>. Prior to choosing the installation area of air conditioning system, a number of primary factors need to be thought about. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units must not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there need to not be any obstacles en route of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outside unit needs to likewise be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently released outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop sharply. It is extremely recommended to set up the a/c unit units in quickly available places, for more maintenance during operation.<p>
