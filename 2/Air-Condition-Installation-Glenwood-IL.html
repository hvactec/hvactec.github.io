This is generally used in a second or third-floor  location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
