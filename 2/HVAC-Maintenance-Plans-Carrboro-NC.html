<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Carrboro NC</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t truly think about anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itÃ¢ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might pick to replace the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit.
