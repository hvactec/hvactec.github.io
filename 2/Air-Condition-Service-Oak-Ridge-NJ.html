<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
