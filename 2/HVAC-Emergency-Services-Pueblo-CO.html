The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything requires to be changed ultimately. As equipment ages, it ends up being less effective.

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
