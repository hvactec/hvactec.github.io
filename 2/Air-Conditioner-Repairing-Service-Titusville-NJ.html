<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
