<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel need to be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
