<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very thorough in discussing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered fantastic client service at the end of the visit by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time using Around the Clock. Ilan always makes himself available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is skilled with these devices). I have nothing however excellent things to state - he has taken great care of my heating and AC needs. Quick action - fast resolution.<p>
<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
