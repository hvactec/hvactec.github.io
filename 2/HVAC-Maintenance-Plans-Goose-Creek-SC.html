<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Goose Creek SC</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
