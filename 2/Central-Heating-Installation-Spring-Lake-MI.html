While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same).

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, think about prospective effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's directions, specifically directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater appropriately adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
