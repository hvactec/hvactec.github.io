<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure."

The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
