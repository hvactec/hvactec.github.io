These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not use contracts.  The so called respectable companies swindle more people than the fly by night outfits.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space cooling provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
