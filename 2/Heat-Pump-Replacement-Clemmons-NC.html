<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be heated in cooler months by moving and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures discovered just a few feet below ground. In the summertime, the procedure reverses, thereby cooling a home by removing heat. Underground temperature level stays constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems provide reliable and constant heating and cooling.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely define the quantity (and often quality) of outdoor air that must be constantly supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation combined with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
