Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still warms to the right temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. If your house is not heating up, just be worried. However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.
