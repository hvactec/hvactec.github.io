<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
