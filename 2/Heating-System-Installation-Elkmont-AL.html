<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My eldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
