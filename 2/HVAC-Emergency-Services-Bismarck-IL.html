<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
