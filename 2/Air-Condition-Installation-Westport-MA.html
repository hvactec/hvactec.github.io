<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Westport</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than designs made 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to replace or upgrade your system if it's five years old or older.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
