<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
