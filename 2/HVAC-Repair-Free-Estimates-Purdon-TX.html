<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They include delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Children, infants, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
