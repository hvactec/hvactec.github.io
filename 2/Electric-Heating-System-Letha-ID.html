<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
