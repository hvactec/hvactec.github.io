<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a South Saint Paul MN HVAC Company</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of clinical evidence has shown that the air within houses and other buildings can be more seriously contaminated than the outside air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that people spend roughly 90 percent of their time inside. Therefore, for many people, the risks to health may be greater due to direct exposure to air contamination inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
