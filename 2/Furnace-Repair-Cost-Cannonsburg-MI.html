Ventilation, a typical technique of reducing exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will decrease but not eliminate direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that cigarette smoking produces such large quantities of contaminants, natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not remove them from the air in your house as quickly as they develop.
