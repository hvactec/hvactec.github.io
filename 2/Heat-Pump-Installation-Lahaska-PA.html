<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day.

<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however many utilize the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better solution. If the present system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
