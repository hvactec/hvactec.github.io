They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you anticipate it to.

Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
