<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most cost effective if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas prior to we provide advice to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
