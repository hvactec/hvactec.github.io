<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
