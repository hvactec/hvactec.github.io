<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>The technological developments in heating equipment have actually been improving every year. Boilers and heating systems now use less fuel to provide heat and hot water, are much easier to maintain, and are also smaller and quieter.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair.
