<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
