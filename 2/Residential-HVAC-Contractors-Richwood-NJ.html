<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group excels in incorporating a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges. As snowfall blankets much of the Meridian area come wintertime, it's time to ensure your heater is all set for the tough task at hand. No matter what HVAC system you use to heat your home, trust us for all your heating needs. Our service technicians have the experience to do the job, no matter the size of your system. Since the Treasure Valley location can see some incredibly cold temperatures, maintenance and system maintenance is more important than ever. The lower the temperature levels, the more work your heating system has to endure.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>When central air service fails during a heat spell, you may have to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to appear, and you'll most likely pay a minimum of several hundred for the repair.

<p>Additionally, house owners have a range of choices to select from in powering a flooring heating unit. Radiant systems work with electrical, gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources.
