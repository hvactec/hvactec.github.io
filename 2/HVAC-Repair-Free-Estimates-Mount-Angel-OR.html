<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
