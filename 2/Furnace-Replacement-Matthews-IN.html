<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne item of a biological pollutant. Biological impurities in the house may consist of mold, bacteria, viruses, mites, and pollen.
