<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time.
