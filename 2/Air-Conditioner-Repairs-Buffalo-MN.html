Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Buffalo MN</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
