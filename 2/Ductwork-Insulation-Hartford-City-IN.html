Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil.
