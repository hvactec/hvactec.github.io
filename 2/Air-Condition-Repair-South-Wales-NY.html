If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated delay features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
