<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>The first a/c and refrigerators used harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold enjoy wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other allergens under control.
