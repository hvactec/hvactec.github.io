We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioner before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
