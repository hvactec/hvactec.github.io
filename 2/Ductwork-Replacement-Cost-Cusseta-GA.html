<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Cusseta GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
