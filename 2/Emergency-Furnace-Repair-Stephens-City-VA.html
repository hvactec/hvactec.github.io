<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in Stephens City VA</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being far more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heatpump are commonly installed in tandem with a more standard form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Stephens City VA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most inexpensive if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
