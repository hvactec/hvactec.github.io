<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
