<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

<p>In basic, ductless AC units are more energy-efficient and environment-friendly than standard Heating and coolings. This is due to the fact that you can shut off specific spaces when you're not occupying them. On top of that, ductless ACs can raise and reduce their temperature quickly, conserving you energy and money that routine HVAC compressors will squander by constantly starting up and turning themselves off.<p>

Too large and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c will not be able to cool your house properly. These are just a few of the aspects that you need to take into consideration when shopping for a new AC system.
