<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
