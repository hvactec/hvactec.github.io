<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
