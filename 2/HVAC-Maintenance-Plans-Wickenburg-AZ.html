<p>When installing radiant heat, you should give severe thought to the kind of flooring covering in the home. Because it conducts and shops heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work reasonably well. Carpets will straight insulate the floor from the room, reducing performance, so if you want to set up carpet in a radiant-heated room, use a thin carpet with thick cushioning.<p>
<p>House owners may also assume that because a glowing floor heating system can be seen (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will immediately raise their home's worth. No evidence exists recommending that in-floor heating either positively or negatively impacts home values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Publication. Perhaps Real estate agents must consider a lot of variables to definitively specify what a radiant heat system may add to, or subtract from, any offered asking cost. That said, property buyers wanting to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating system will be willing to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
