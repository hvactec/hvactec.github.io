<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>More frequently, however, detectives will require to come to the structure to conduct individual interviews with residents, to search for possible sources of the problems, and to inspect the style and operation of the ventilation system and other structure features.
