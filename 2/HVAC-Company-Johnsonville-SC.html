Soil by roads and highways might be infected from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet prior to going into the home. Alter your clothes before you go home and clean these clothes individually if you work with lead in your job or a pastime.
