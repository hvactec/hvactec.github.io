<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in location. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, causing holes and cracks. , if that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. a very beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
