<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
