<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level.
