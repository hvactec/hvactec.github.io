According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it might just require to be cleaned. Whether or not this is the reason for the problem, it's a great early treatment to attempt. Strategy to do this on a reasonably warm day. Never use a power washer for this-- it can harm the fins.

<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one action mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repeated use of a component that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  a really beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
