<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
