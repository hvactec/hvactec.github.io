There are emergency security changes that protect your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
