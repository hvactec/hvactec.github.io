According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater.

<p>My oldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
