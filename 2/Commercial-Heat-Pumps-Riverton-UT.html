<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
