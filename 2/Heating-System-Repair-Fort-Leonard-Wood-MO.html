<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Fort Leonard Wood MO</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We picked getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
