<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to preserve and comprehend.<p>
