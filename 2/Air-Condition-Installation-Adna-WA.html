Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
