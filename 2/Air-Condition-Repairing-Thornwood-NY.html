<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't understand why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's most likely your problem. The next action is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing. The most convenient way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
