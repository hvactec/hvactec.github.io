<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be set up in a new building. Forced air systems will need a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heating systems will require water-to-water heatpump. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the cooling and heating requirements for your house and is critical iin making sure the performance and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in heaps. Generally, a 3-ton setup must be adequate for the typical home, however home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all aspects which will affect the appropriate size for your specific home.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Place control includes moving the toxin source far from occupants or perhaps relocating vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>When setting up radiant heating, you must give major thought to the kind of flooring covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well because it conducts and stores heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work reasonably well. Carpeting will directly insulate the flooring from the space, decreasing effectiveness, so if you wish to install carpet in a radiant-heated space, utilize a thin carpet with thick padding.<p>
<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps men working. When a sales man pertains to your home he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid.
