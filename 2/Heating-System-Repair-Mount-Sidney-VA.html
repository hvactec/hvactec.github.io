<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs in between $300 to $500 on average.

By choosing a central AC unit that has as high of an efficiency ranking as possible, you can decrease your carbon footprint and save cash in the long run.

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, think about prospective results of indoor air pollution.
