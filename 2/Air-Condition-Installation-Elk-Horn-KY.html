<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
