<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my demand.

<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Tierra Amarilla NM HVAC Company</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>First, understand that a bulk of your central air conditioning and unit cost will originate from the system itself. AC system costs start at $2,000 and can in fact go beyond $10,000 for larger houses. As you saw just recently, you need an appropriately-sized unit for your home. Otherwise, the AC will break down earlier than anticipated or your monthly energy costs will escalate. Therefore, you don't have overall control regarding your AC unit product expenses.<p>
