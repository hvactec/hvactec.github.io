<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating unit, you may look for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or exceptionally hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>

In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex problems-- determined by regularly undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, one of the three methods below may be proper.<p>
