Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save cash over the long term since of the lower energy expenses. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as traditional air-source systems.
