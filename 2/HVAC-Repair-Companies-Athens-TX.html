<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
