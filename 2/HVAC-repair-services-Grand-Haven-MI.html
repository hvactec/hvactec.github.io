<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
