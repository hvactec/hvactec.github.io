Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
