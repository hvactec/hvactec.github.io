The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
