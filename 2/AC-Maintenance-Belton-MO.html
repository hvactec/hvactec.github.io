<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
