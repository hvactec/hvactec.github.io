<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
