<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema.

<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air.
