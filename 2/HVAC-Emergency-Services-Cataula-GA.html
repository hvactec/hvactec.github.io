<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heaters have multiple control panel. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard.

Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
