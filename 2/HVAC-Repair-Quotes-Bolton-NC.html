<p>The very first ac system and refrigerators employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered with a Bolton NC HVAC Company</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
