There have actually been awkward noises. I got it repaired and examined. I am hoping that is completion of the issue. Overall, it has actually been a good experience. Reliable on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the start. But then recognized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by qualified HVAC professionals. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many people.<p>
