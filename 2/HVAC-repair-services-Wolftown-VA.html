<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.
