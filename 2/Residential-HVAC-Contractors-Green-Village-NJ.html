<p>We needed 2 check outs - Jake came out first and was really well-informed and enjoyable and polite. Grant came out a couple days later on and was nice and also knowledgeable to speak to. They both did a terrific job. Sabre's office staff is very valuable, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and providing the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are likewise well priced for their services. Definitely suggest.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
