<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and large houses.

A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
