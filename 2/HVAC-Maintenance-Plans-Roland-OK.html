<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one ecological hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A great place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's type of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as just one element (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
