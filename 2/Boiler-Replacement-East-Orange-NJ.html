<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Soil by highways and roads might be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet before going into the home. If you work with lead in your job or a hobby, change your clothes prior to you go house and wash these clothes separately. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas rather of dirt which adheres to fingers and toys.
