<p>My eldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t truly consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itÃ¢ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be permitted to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and preserve.<p>
