<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
