<p>Because they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
