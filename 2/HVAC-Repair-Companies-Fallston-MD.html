Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
