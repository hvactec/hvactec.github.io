<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are offered to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Client Service! Climate Pro is trusted and really cared about us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated house once again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Since approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage. Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions because they do not require any new ductwork to be installed. Because a system is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
