<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
