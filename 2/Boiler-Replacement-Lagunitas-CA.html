He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead.

If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
