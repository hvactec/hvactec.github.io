<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient.

Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

Had the ability to come at 8 AM.

The only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>
