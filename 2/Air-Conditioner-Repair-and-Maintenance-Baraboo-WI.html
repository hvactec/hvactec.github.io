<h3>Ventilation System in Baraboo WI</h3>
<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps should likewise be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, locals must be alert to the development of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization measures must not be undertaken till these issues have been remedied.<p>
