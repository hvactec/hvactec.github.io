<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
