<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
