<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
