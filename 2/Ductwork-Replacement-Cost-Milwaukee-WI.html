<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Milwaukee WI</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
