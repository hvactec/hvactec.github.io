<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Harrison AR</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioning unit, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c be? Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning system won't be able to cool the house effectively. These are simply a few of the factors that you require to take into consideration when shopping for a new AC system. Each choice can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to disregard any of them.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a company eventually. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big business in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
