These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact.

What this means is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
