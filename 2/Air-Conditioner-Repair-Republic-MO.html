Not all heating systems benefit all homes, and there are a couple of factors that absolutely require to be thought about prior to choosing one. First, you'll need one that is correctly sized for your home. A furnace that is too big will put out excessive heat for your system to deal with, and will cause problems like short-cycling that can reduce its life. A furnace that is too little, on the other hand, will not be able to provide sufficient heat to keep your home comfortable.<p>
<p>Some health effects might appear shortly after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are treatable and generally short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some illness such as asthma may show up, be exacerbated or worsened.<p>
