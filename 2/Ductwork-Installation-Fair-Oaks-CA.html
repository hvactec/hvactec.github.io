<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
