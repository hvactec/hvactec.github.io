<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Particular immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently hard to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution.
