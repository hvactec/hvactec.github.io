<h3>What Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Amo IN?</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
