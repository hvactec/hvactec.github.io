<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have actually been correctly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
