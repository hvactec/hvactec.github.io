<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part.
