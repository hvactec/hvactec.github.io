<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Usually the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to comprehend and preserve.<p>
