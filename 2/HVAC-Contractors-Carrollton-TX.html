<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
