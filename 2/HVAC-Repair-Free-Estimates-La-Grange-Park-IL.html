<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit.

<h3>Electric Heat Pump in La Grange Park IL</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>You must constantly hire an expert to conduct AC repair, for the exact same reason that you trust an expert plumbing professional or electrical expert.
