<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold like moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% assists keep them and other allergens under control.

<p>Outdoor impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Professionals advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and normally are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
