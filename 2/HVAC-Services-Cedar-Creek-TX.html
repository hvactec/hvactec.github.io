<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
