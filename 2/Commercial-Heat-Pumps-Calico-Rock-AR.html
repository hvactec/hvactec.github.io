<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is committed to supplying a work environment that is without acknowledged dangers and to examination problems that may be associated with bad indoor air quality (IAQ).
