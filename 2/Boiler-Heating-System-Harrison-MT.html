<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Harrison MT?</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went ahead and bought this Carrier and I must state it gets the job done rather well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool down your house which is among the things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had before. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
