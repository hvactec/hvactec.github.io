<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings build up inside, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>

<p>Excellent contractors utilize load-calculating software application that consider such information as the number of windows in your house, the density of insulation, the setup of the attic, and the building's orientation to the sun. It produces not only a specific tonnage requirement, but figures out how much cool air each room requires. All bids (get at least three, from licensed, well-regarded companies) should include this one-page hard copy.<p>

<p>To successfully deal with EJ concerns, the Firm acknowledges that neighborhoods should be the inspiration for executing local solutions for ecological illness including indoor air.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by many public water materials, it has been discovered in well water. If you've evaluated the air in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>5. Odor good naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney aroma with a clean kitchen or tidy synthetic scents in laundry items and air fresheners emit dozens of different chemicals into the air. You won't discover their names on the item labels. Standard laundry cleaning agents, fabric softeners, dryer sheets, and air fresheners in strong, spray, and oil kind may all release such gasses.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
