<p>A third way to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your house may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To find odors in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
