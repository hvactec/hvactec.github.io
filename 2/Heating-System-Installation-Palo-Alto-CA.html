The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the issue and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Your Review This is my third time using All the time. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these gadgets). I have nothing but terrific things to state - he has taken excellent care of my heating and AC needs. Quick reaction - quick resolution.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider potential results of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's instructions, particularly directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system effectively changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
