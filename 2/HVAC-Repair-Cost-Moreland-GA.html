<p>They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs totally by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your problem. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you found that your conditioning filter needs changing. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
