There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
