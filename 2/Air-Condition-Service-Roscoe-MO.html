<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Roscoe MO</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
