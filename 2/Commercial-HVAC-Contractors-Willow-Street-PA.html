<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
