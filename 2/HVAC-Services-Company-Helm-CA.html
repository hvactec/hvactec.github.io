<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
