<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
