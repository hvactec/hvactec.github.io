<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Urbana MO</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
