<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may become blocked, decreasing air flow distribution, quality, and volume. They also might become locations for molds and bacteria to grow and be distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be effectively maintained to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other types of a/c, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to preserve and understand.<p>
