<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards normally amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
