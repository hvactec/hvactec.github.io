<h3>Central Heating Repair in Salem OR</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
