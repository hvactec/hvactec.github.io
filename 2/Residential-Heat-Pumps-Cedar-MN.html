<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window.
