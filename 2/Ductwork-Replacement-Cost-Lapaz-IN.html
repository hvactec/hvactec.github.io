<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>The very first a/c unit and fridges utilized flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
