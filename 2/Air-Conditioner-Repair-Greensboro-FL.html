<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
