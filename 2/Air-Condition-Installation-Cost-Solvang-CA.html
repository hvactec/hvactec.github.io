<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
