The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a straightforward and effective  method to minimize ambient air pollution and potential health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
