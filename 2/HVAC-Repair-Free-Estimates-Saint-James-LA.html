With a variety of designs across three line of product, the Convenience, Efficiency, and Infinity, Provider is able to provide solutions for nearly any house heating requirement and budget.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat.

<p>The primary factor house owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the quantity of services offered.

However, some manufacturers need routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>No matter what sort of heating unit you have in your home, you can save cash and increase your comfort by properly maintaining and updating your devices.
