<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
