<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't position the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it since it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.
