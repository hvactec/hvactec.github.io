Their techs are expert and really knowledgeable. Costs are affordable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser this week. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff due to the fact that the cost was certainly reasonable.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
