<p>Created to improve manufacturing process control in a printing plant, Provider's creation managed not only temperature but also humidity Carrier utilized his understanding of the heating of items with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the room manageable. The regulated temperature level and humidity helped preserve constant paper dimensions and ink positioning.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema.
