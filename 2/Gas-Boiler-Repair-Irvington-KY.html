<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Irvington KY</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment.

The outside condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
