<p>Enhance your services, make more services revenue, and offer an incredible consumer experience. To ensure the unit you select is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the exact kind of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we do not just change it with the same size system you presently have. These computations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is necessary so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same period. Generally, SEER supplies more data based upon how the EER carries out in various temps. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
