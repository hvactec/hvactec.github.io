<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Heating System Installation in Saline MI</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
