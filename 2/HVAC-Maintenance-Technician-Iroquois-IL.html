<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at sensible energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video footage alone. Just like determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, identifying the correct size of unit for your house also depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
