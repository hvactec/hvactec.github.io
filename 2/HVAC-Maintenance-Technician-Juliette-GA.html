<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
