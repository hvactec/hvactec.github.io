<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and offices matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives inside. A/c unit assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
