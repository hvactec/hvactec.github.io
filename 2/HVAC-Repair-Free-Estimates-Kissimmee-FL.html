<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has determined structure materials, furnishings, and mold as serious issues, however much of the danger likewise comes from burning things.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
