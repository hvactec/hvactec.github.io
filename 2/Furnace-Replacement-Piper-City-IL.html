<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Customer Reports National Research Center.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>My oldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
