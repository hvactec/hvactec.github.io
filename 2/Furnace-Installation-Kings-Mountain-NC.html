Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
