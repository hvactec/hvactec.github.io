They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to purchase it. My better half stated that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good people I have satisfied in a very long time.

Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
