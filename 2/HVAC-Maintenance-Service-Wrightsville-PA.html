<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Wrightsville PA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
