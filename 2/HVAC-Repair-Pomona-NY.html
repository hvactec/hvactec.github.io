<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. Often there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in surprise or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
