<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
