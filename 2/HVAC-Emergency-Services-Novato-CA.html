<h3>The Way to Soundproof a Central Heating System in Novato CA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Cleaning in Novato CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
