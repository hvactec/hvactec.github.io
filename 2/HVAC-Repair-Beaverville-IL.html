<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay features when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an a/c, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the ac system be?

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
