<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
