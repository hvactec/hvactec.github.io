<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
