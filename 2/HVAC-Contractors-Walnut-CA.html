<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in collecting information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
