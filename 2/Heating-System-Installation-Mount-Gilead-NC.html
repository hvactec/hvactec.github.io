<p>Seattle heaters can run 9 months of the year. Based upon the average temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life expectancy of 15 years.

<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>To start, it's a good concept to consider energy performance. By choosing a central AC unit that has as high of an efficiency score as possible, you can decrease your carbon footprint and save money in the long run. Performance rankings must be labeled with all systems. While efficient systems might cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated home appliance is an excellent method to enjoy additional comfort.<p>

You will also enjoy a a lot more flexible system in regards to installation and cost. And because each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when one person would prefer it a little warmer in a various space.<p>
