<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with your house.

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, because it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>

Fortunately is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
