<p>Stability Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and changed two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new furnaces can heat your house.

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
