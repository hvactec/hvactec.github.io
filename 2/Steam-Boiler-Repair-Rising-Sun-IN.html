<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
