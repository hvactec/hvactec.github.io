<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Pushed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install.
