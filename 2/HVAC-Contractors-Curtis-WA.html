<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
