<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they diagnosed the issue and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution.
