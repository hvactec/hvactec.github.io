<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
