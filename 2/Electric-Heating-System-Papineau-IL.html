<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
