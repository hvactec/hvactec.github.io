<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done.
