<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>One of the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly costly to install, particularly in an older home.

<p>The bureau projects 34 percent work growth for HVAC technicians between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations. Several factors contribute to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older air conditioning systems to satisfy stricter environmental policies. The slow rebound in residential and commercial building will create a steady circulation of brand-new chances, especially for technicians who want to move.
