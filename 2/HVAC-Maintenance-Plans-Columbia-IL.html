<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
