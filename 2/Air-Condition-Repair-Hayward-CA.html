<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Hayward CA?</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more extreme with lower outside temperatures, so heatpump are typically set up in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
