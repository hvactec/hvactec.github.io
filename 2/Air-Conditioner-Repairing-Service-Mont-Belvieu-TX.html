<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
