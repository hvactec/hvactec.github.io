<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
