<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Services in Franklin</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes trapped in buildings and concentrations build up inside, direct exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>
