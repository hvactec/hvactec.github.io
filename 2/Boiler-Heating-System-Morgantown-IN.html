<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
